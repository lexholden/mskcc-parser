      "How It Works": "There is no scientific evidence to support the use of 714X.\n714X is a chemical mixture that was developed by Gaston Naessens, a French biologist from Canada. Although several claims have been made for 714X, such as cancer regression and revitalizing the immune system, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration analyzed the contents of 714X and found that it contains relatively inactive ingredients: 94% water, 5% nitrate, and tiny amounts of sodium, chloride, and camphor. Whereas such a mixture may not be harmful to the body, there are no data to show that 714X can treat cancer or HIV.",

      "Clinical Summary": "Acupuncture is an integral component of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) that originated more than 2,000 years ago. Treatment involves stimulation of one or more predetermined points on the body with needles, heat (moxibustion), pressure (acupressure), or electricity (electroacupuncture, EA) for therapeutic effect.Acupuncture is beneficial for osteoarthritis of the knee , chronic neck pain , Bell’s palsy , and fibromyalgia symptoms . Acupressure  and acupuncture  were superior to physical therapy and/or usual care in treating patients with low back pain. Acupuncture reduced high blood pressure  and hot flash severity  in postmenopausal women. It was shown to be as effective as counseling for depression symptoms , but had mixed results for treating major depressive disorder . Acupuncture reduced stroke risk in patients with traumatic brain injury . Data from clinical trials also support its use for chronic headache , and although there was no difference between true and sham acupuncture, both treatments were more effective compared with a no-acupuncture control Electroacupuncture was found to be as helpful for stress urinary incontinence as behavioral treatments such as pelvic floor muscle training, with patients expressing similar satisfaction with results . Acupuncture is used to improve reproductive outcomes in women following in vitro fertilization, but clinical studies yielded conflicting results . It increased ovulation frequency but reduced sex steroid levels in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)  . In a large multicenter trial, acupuncture was not found to be helpful for PCOS infertility . Acupuncture did not have an analgesic effect in women undergoing induced labor , but reduced symptoms of chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain , and decreased procedural anxiety in patients undergoing lithotripsy . In children, acupressure also appeared to reduce preprocedural anxiety , while EA reduced postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) . Acupuncture was also shown to benefit patients with allergic rhinitis , including pediatric patients Acupuncture may help in smoking cessation , although other analytic reviews are mixed on its efficacy . It is also a useful adjunct to standard treatment for dyspnea on exertion, a symptom associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD) . Furthermore, data suggest that when added to routine care, acupuncture treatment improves the health-related quality of life in patients with allergic asthma In patients undergoing autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, acupuncture prevented escalation of symptoms such as nausea, lack of appetite, and drowsiness, and reduced the use of pain medications . In breast cancer patients, acupuncture alleviated aromatase inhibitor-induced joint pain and stiffness, improving physical well-being  and quality of life . EA significantly improved fatigue, anxiety, and depression as well as arthralgia compared with usual care . Acupuncture was also as effective as standard care for hot flashes , and EA may be more effective than gabapentin with fewer side effects . EA was also shown comparable to gabapentin for improving sleep quality in women experiencing hot flashes . Early phase studies also suggest that acupuncture may relieve hot flashes in prostate cancer patients . Effects of acupuncture for menopausal hot flashes in non-cancer patients are mixed . Acupuncture can improve pain and well-being in lung cancer patients  and benefits have also been observed for peripheral neuropathy , including that associated with diabetes , AIDS , and chemotherapy . Acupuncture did not reduce postoperative ileus from standard surgery , but EA did reduce postoperative ileus and analgesic use after laparoscopic surgery for colorectal cancer In palliative cancer care, acupuncture is being evaluated as an intervention to reduce cachexia and unintentional weight loss . Its use has also been associated with increased appetite . Various forms of acupuncture have been found to alleviate pain , xerostomia following head and neck radiotherapy , fatigue , PONV , and chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) Acupuncture is generally safe, well tolerated , and cost-effective . Some conditions require continuous treatments in order to achieve long-term effect. Animal studies suggest caffeine can inhibit the pain relieving effect of acupuncture . Pregnant women, patients with lymphedema, those wearing pacemakers, and those with low platelet count should inform their practitioners before receiving treatment.Cancer patients considering acupuncture should seek certified or state-licensed practitioners who have training or experience in working with cancer patients. Clinical trials at MSK are underway to evaluate acupuncture for chronic pain in cancer patients and for distress-related insomnia in caregivers",

      "Mechanism of Action": "According to TCM, acupuncture points are thought to be located at specific areas along channels or meridians. Qi (pronounced chee, meaning energy) is believed to flow in this network of channels which connect different parts of the body and organs into a unified system. Pain and symptoms of disease are thought to arise when the flow of Qi is stagnated. Acupuncture treatments are used to promote the flow of Qi to relieve symptoms. It is also known to stimulate release of endogenous opioids.Scientific studies have demonstrated that acupuncture can induce analgesia, but that effect was blocked by naloxone, an opioid antagonist . Further, mice lacking opiate receptors showed low analgesic effect following electroacupuncture (EA) . Acupuncture also increases neuropeptide Y in animals suggesting it may help to reduce stress and depression . Recent research shows that EA inhibits pain through different opioid receptors under varying conditions, but the mechanisms warrant further investigation . EA was shown to increase ovarian blood flow via ovarian sympathetic nerves in rats In women with polycystic ovary syndrome, acupuncture treatments increased ovulation frequency through the local peripheral effect on ovaries and not by stimulating the sex steroids . Acupuncture protects against cerebral ischemia by increasing blood flow to the ischemic brain region via neural regulation . The systemic antiinflammatory activities of EA are thought to be modulated by dopamine Studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have shown that acupuncture elicits changes in the brain that appear to correlate with neurological effects produced . Needling of LI-2, one of several acupoints used to treat xerostomia, is associated with neuroimaging changes correlated to saliva production . Results from a study done in patients with peripheral neuropathy indicate that acupuncture improves nerve conduction The long-term post-treatment benefits seen with EA, and to a lesser extent with sham-EA, but not with gabapentin for the treatment of hot flashes among breast cancer survivors suggest that both types of acupuncture produce underlying physiologic changes not induced by pharmacologic intervention . That sham-EA demonstrated greater placebo effects with reduced nocebo effects than pill-placebo  also may explain why some acupuncture trials find similar efficacy between active and sham interventions. Other data indicate that a higher baseline expectancy of response predicts treatment response with sham-EA but not EA, suggesting there are divergent mechanisms and that patients who have a low expectancy may do better with EA than sham-EA ",

But more studies are needed to confirm these observations.Agaricus blazei is an edible mushroom grown in Brazil and Japan. It is used to treat arteriosclerosis, hepatitis, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, dermatitis, and cancer. Laboratory studies and experiments done in mice have shown that agaricus can stimulate the immune system and has anticancer effects. Compounds present in agaricus prevent formation of blood vessels needed for tumor development.",

      "Scientific Name": "Agaricus blazei Murrill",
      "Clinical Summary": "Agaricus blazei is an edible mushroom native to Brazil and is cultivated in Japan for medicinal uses. It has been used to treat arteriosclerosis, hepatitis, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, dermatitis, and cancer. The polysaccharides and anti-angiogenic compounds present in agaricus are thought to be responsible for its antitumor properties. Agaricus was also shown to have antidiabetic effects in vitro and in animal studies Studies using agaricus extracts suggest beneficial effects including improving insulin resistance in diabetic patients ; reducing weight, body fat, and serum glucose and cholesterol levels in healthy individuals ; and improving quality of life in patients with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis \nThe anticancer potential of agaricus has been explored in a few studies as well. The antitumor and immunomodulatory effects of agaricus have been shown to be via immunopotentiation or direct inhibition of angiogenesis . And an agaricus extract enhanced doxorubicin-induced apoptosis against drug-resistant human hepatocellular carcinoma . Oral administration of the extract improved the natural killer cell activity and quality of life in gynecological cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy . Preliminary data show that daily intake of agaricus powder improves quality of life among cancer patients in remission ; and supplementation with an agaricus extract resulted in immunomodulatory effects, although no improvements were reported in survival in patients with multiple myeloma . Agaricus extract did not confer any benefits in elderly females . Larger studies are needed to resolve the ambiguity.\nWhereas a small study reported that agaricus extract may improve liver function in patients with hepatitis B , liver damage and deaths  along with cheilitis  have been reported following consumption. Brefeldin A, a compound isolated from agaricus, was shown to have estrogenic activity, but did not stimulate growth of breast cancer cells ",

      "Mechanism of Action": "Agaricus extract was shown to exert estrogen-like activity and may help prevent atherosclerosis via dual roles in cell signaling, macrophage development suppression and endothelial cell recovery from vascular damage . Both aqueous and organic extracts of agaricus offered protection to cells exposed to methyl methanesulphonate, a mutagenic agent. The stimulus produced by linoleic acid on beta-DNA polymerase, an enzyme involved in repair mechanism following exposure of DNA to alkylating agents, is thought responsible for such an effect Ergosterol, a major constituent of agaricus, was found to inhibit tumor growth in mice via direct inhibition of tumor-induced angiogenesis . Other studies demonstrated that polysaccharides present in agaricus extract caused activation of macrophages  or natural killer cells  and induced cytotoxic T-lymphocyte activity in tumor-bearing mice. Specifically, activation of natural killer cells was mediated through IL-12-induced IFN-gamma expression . Furthermore, agaricus extract stimulates caspase 3 activation and reduces telomerase activity  possibly through regulation of Akt signaling  thereby inducing apoptosis in cancer cell lines. Blazeispirol A, produced by agaricus fermentation, causes both caspase-dependent and -independent cell death in human Hep 3B cells . Agaritine, a hydrazine-containing constituent also exhibits anti-tumor activity toward U937 leukemic cells mediated through apoptosis . In another study, polysaccharides isolated from agaricus were shown to induce apoptosis in HL-60 cells through a signaling cascade of mitochondrial caspase-3-dependent pathway ",

      "How It Works": "AHCC has immunomodulatory and anticancer effects. But large human studies are lacking.\nActive hexose correlated compound (AHCC) is an extract of mushrooms from the Basidiomycete class, including shiitake mushrooms. This product contains polysaccharides called glucans, which scientists think are responsible for its biological activity.  One study showed that it could enhance the activity of natural killer cells (a type of immune cell) in the test tube. Animal studies suggest that AHCC has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, and can improve the response of the immune system in mice with chemotherapy-weakened immune systems. In humans, AHCC has been shown to improve liver function in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and cirrhosis and reduce the levels of certain tumor markers in the blood.",
      "Purported Uses": "To prevent and treat cancer\nLaboratory studies show some anti-cancer activity, but these results are not especially strong. One human study supported the use of AHCC in patients undergoing surgical resection of hepatocellular carcinoma, but this study had design flaws and much more research is needed.\nAnother study found AHCC to be an ineffective treatment for early stage prostate cancer.",
      "Do Not Take If": [
        [
          "You are taking drugs that are substrates of",
          "Cytochrome P450 2D6",
          "(AHCC can decrease the effects of such drugs)."
        ]
      ],
      "Side Effects": [
        "Diarrhea and itching have been reported in patients following administration of AHCC."
      ],
      "Clinical Summary": "A proprietary extract prepared from co-cultured mycelia of several species of Basidiomycete mushrooms, including shiitake (Lentinus edodes) active hexose correlated compound (AHCC) is extracted using hot water following an enzyme pretreatment, but the specific mushroom source and procedural details have not been fully disclosed. Patients use AHCC to prevent and treat cancer. Animal studies suggest that AHCC has antioxidant effects and may protect against many disorders that are induced by oxidative stress ; enhances resistance against bacterial  and viral infections ; and due to its anti-inflammatory effects, is effective against colitis . A study of healthy subjects aged 50 years and older suggests that AHCC improves T-cell immune responses via increased production of interferon-l and tumor necrosis factor-alpha for up to 30 days after treatment . In healthy humans, AHCC increased dendritic cell number and function  and short-term supplementation with AHCC was shown to improve the antibody response to influenza vaccine \nIn vitro and animal studies show that AHCC has anticancer effects . In cisplatin-treated mice, AHCC increased its anti-tumor activity while reducing side effects ; and showed synergistic effects with gemcitabine in pancreatic cancer cells . A prospective cohort study suggested that AHCC improves prognosis after curative resection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) . AHCC may also reduce chemotherapy-associated adverse effects in patients with advanced cancer , and in those  with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) . However, an open-label multicenter study of patients with early stage prostate cancer found that AHCC was ineffective in reducing patient prostrate-specific antigen levels by 50% or more . More studies are needed.",
      "Purported Uses2": [
        "Cancer prevention",
        "Cancer treatment"
      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "AHCC glucans are low molecular weight (~5 KDa) polysaccharides with alpha-1,3 linkages. Both properties are unusual for this class of mushroom glucans with reported immunomodulatory properties . One of the proposed mechanisms includes orchestrating immune response and maintening immune homeostasis in part by priming the TLR-2 and TLR-4 (toll-like receptors) gate at the intestinal epithelium . AHCC has been shown to enhance natural killer (NK) cell activity in vitro, induce endogenous IL-12 in mice , and improve murine response to influenza infection . An animal study suggested that AHCC has antioxidant effects and may protect against disorders induced by oxidative stress . Other studies have shown that it increases resistance to bacterial infection  by increasing inflammatory cytokine and chemokine expression as well as lymphocytes . AHCC also enhanced murine resistance to West Nile virus by improving T-cell response \nIn chemotherapy-induced granulocytopenic mice, AHCC improved immune response to Candida albicans, and alleviated the side effects induced by anticancer drugs in rodents, but the molecular mechanisms have yet to be determined . In healthy adults aged 50 years or more, AHCC was shown to enhance CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell immune responses , and In patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cirrhosis, it conferred beneficial effects on liver function  possibly by regulating nitric oxide (NO) production In addition, AHCC was shown to enhance the antitumor effects of 5-fluorouracil by enhancing apoptosis in tumor tissue, and by upregulating the expression of BCl-2 associated X protein and downregulating B cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) . AHCC may be also useful in overcoming drug resistance in cancer cells. Proposed mechanisms include downregulation of Heat Shock Factor 1, which induces the heat shock protein HSP27, known to be involved in gemcitabine resistance in pancreatic cancer cells ",

      "How It Works": "Alfalfa may be effective at reducing cholesterol levels, but there is no evidence that it can treat cancer and it has many side effects.\nAlfalfa contains fiber and a substance called saponins, which are thought to bind with cholesterol in the body and may reduce cholesterol levels. Alfalfa plants also contain phytoestrogens, which act like some human hormones. In fact, alfalfa phytoestrogens caused the growth of estrogen-dependent breast cancer cells. Alfalfa seeds also contain a toxic amino acid, L-canavanine. Levels of this amino acid vary widely across various cultivations of plants, and decrease as the plant matures. It is thought that this amino acid may be responsible for alfalfa’s ability to cause a relapse of lupus symptoms in patients who are in remission from the disease, and large levels of L-canavanine from alfalfa supplementation may have additional detrimental effects in humans.\nBecause it also has a significant estrogenic effect, patients with hormone-sensitive cancers should avoid alfalfa.",

      "Scientific Name": "Medicago sativa",
      "Clinical Summary": "The leaves and seeds of this widely used food crop are thought to have diuretic properties, to be effective against diabetes, thyroid gland malfunction, arthritis, high cholesterol, and peptic ulcers , and to promote menstruation and lactation . Alfalfa is also a popular treatment for asthma and hay fever . It is claimed to be a source of vitamins A, C, E, and K and of the minerals, calcium, potassium, phosphorus, and iron . In vitro studies indicate that alfalfa sprout extracts exhibit neuroprotective  and estrogenic activities . And alfalfa was found to lower cholesterol levels in humans in small uncontrolled trials L-canavanine, a toxic amino acid present in alfalfa seeds was shown to affect T cells . Whether high enough concentrations of this substance are obtained through supplementation is uncertain . In another study, rats that were fed alfalfa were more susceptible to colon cancer, although such effects have not been observed in humans . Ingestion of contaminated alfalfa sprouts and seeds resulted in fatalities  and salmonellosis . Listeriosis has also been reported following consumption of contaminated alfalfa tablets . Because alfalfa sprouts have estrogenic effects, patients with estrogen-sensitive cancers should avoid alfalfa supplementation.",
      "Food Sources": "Alfalfa seeds and sprouts are available around the world and used frequently as animal feed.",
      "Purported Uses2": [
        "Allergies",
        "Asthma",
        "Diabetes",
        "GI disorders",
        "High cholesterol",
        "Lactation stimulation",
        "Menstrual disorder",
        "Promote urination"
      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "Saponins contained in alfalfa act on the cardiovascular, nervous, and digestive systems . The hypocholesterolemic and hemolytic activity of the leaves and sprouts of alfalfa are attributed to a steroidal saponin fraction which, along with fiber contained within the plant, binds to cholesterol in vitro. Alkaloids such as stachydrine and l-homo-stachydrine found in the seed are thought responsible for alfalfa’s ability to promote menstrual discharge and for its lactogenic activity . Biochanin-A, an isoflavonoid constituent, blocks NF-κB activation by preventing phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα, leading to decreased expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase, thus preventing proliferation and inflammation Extracts from alfalfa preferentially served as agonists for estrogen receptor beta, and alfalfa increased estrogen-dependent MCF-7 breast cancer cell proliferation even more than did estradiol . The non-protein amino acid constituent, L-canavanine, constitutes 1.5% of the dry weight of alfalfa seeds and alfalfa sprouts. It has been shown to affect human T cells in vitro and induce hematologic and serologic abnormalities characteristic of systemic lupus erythematosus in monkeys . This is the proposed mechanism by which systemic lupus erythematosus relapse occurs in humans as well , although some researchers question whether L-canavanine concentrations in alfalfa are sufficient to cause this effect ",
      "Warnings": "Alfalfa should not be consumed during pregnancy and nursing . Patients with latent systemic lupus erythematosus have relapsed after ingesting alfalfa tablets . Alfalfa sprouts have been linked to a number of E. coli and Salmonella infections in California and Europe ",
      "Contraindications": [
        "Due to the high content of purines, alfalfa should be avoided in patients with gout"
      ],
      "Adverse Reactions": [
        "Increased fecal volume and defecation frequency, loose stools and diarrhea as well as abdominal discomfort and intestinal gas have all been reported in patients on alfalfa supplementation"
      ],
      "Herb-Drug Interactions": [
        "Because of its estrogenic activity, high levels of alfalfa may interfere with contraceptives and hormonal therapy"
      ],
      "Herb Lab Interactions": "Alfalfa may increase serum urate and urea levels ",

      "Scientific Name": "Aloe vera, Aloe barbadensis, Aloe capensis",
      "Clinical Summary": "Aloe vera is a perennial, succulent plant that resembles a cactus and is used in traditional medicine throughout the world. The clear thick gel obtained from aloe leaves is used for wound healing, to treat burns, psoriasis, frostbite, ulcerative colitis, diabetes and to relieve constipation. Aloe demonstrated antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties , and an Aloe vera cream has been reported to be superior to silver sulfadiazine creams for the treatment of second-degree burns . A systematic review indicated that aloe was effective against oral lichen planus, and did not cause any adverse effects compared to corticosteroids . In another study, an aloe gel complex was shown to affect reductions in body weight and insulin resistance in obese individuals with pre-diabetes or early untreated diabetes mellitus \nStudies also suggest that constituents of aloe, such as acemannan, aloeride, and di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) have immunomodulating and anticancer effects . Emodin from Aloe vera inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in human liver cancer cell lines through p53- and p21-dependent pathways ; and aloe-emodin enhanced the effects of radiation treatment . Concurrent administration of aloe with chemotherapy may prevent oral mucositis in patients receiving chemotherapy ; and benefit those with metastatic cancers . However, data on external use of aloe products to alleviate radiation-induced skin damage are inconsistent ",

      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "Several studies have been conducted to explore the mechanisms of action of aloe.\nOligosaccharides isolated from aloe extracts were found to prevent ultraviolet radiation-induced suppression of delayed type hypersensitivity by reducing keratinocyte derived immunosuppressive cytokines . A polymer fraction of aloe was shown to protect the gastric mucosa against ethanol-induced gastric damage by decreasing mRNA expression levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP-9). The three enzymes are critical biomarkers in gastric ulceration . According to another study, the radio-protective effects of aloe polysaccharides are most likely due to inhibition of apoptosis \nSome studies have indicated that Aloe vera may have anticancer effects. Emodin, an extract of Aloe vera, can inhibit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis in human liver cancer cell lines through p53- and p21-dependent pathway . Acemannan, a carbohydrate fraction derived from Aloe vera leaf, can stimulate cytokine production in mouse macrophage cell line . It also exhibited immunomodulating activity by inducing maturation of dendritic cells . Another in vitro study has indicated aloeride, a polysaccharide obtained from aloe vera juice, as a potent immunostimulator by increasing NF-kappa B activities . A compound, di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP), isolated from Aloe vera can inhibit leukemic cells in vitro ",
      "Warnings": "Aloe gel should not be confused with aloe juice or aloe latex, both of which contain anthraquinone, a cathartic laxative. Aloe taken for internal use should be discouraged due to possible adverse effects and inconclusive clinical data. Aloe injections for cancer patients have resulted in several deaths.The FDA rules that aloe is not safe as a stimulant laxative",

There is no evidence to support its use to treat diseases such as diabetes, HIV, liver disease, or cancer.\nAlpha lipoic acid is a compound naturally produced by the body that acts as a cofactor in the production of energy. Laboratory studies show that alpha lipoic acid and its metabolite, dihydrolipoic acid (DHLA), have metal-chelating and free radical-scavenging capacities. In addition, DHLA is able to repair oxidative damage and regenerate antioxidants such as vitamin C, vitamin E, and glutathione. However, when taken orally, the amount of alpha lipoic acid delivered to the body varies. Applying a cream containing Alpha-lipoic acid may help prevent wrinkling of skin due to sun exposure.",

      "Scientific Name": "1,2-dithiolane-3-pentanoic acid",
      "Clinical Summary": "Endogenous cofactor found in all eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells that can be obtained in the diet. Patients take this supplement to treat and prevent cancer and to treat diabetes, diabetic neuropathies, HIV/AIDS, and liver disease. Alpha-lipoic acid plays a crucial role in energy production, acts as a potent antioxidant, and exerts apoptotic effects on tumor cells \nIn human studies, alpha-lipoic acid improved insulin sensitivity, vasodilation, and polyneuropathy in patients with diabetes mellitus . Analyses of clinical trials using alpha-lipoic acid showed significant reductions in neuropathic symptoms in diabetic patients . Studies have also been conducted to determine its role in reversing neuropathies  and liver disease , producing mixed results. Findings from another study suggest that topical application of creams containing alpha-lipoic acid may help prevent photoaging of facial skin . Furthermore, current data suggest protective effects of antioxidants against Alzheimer’s disease, but a new study failed to find similar effects with a combination of Coenzyme Q, vitamins C, E, and lipoic acid High doses of alpha-lipoic acid can cause hypoglycemic symptoms . In addition, because of its antioxidant effects, alpha-lipoic acid may antagonize the effects of chemotherapy and radiation therapy.",

      "Mechanism of Action": "Alpha-lipoic acid acts as a lipophilic free radical scavenger. Dihydrolipoic acid (DHLA), a reduced form of lipoic acid, has more potent antioxidant effects. It can assist in repairing oxidative damage and regenerate endogenous antioxidants such as vitamin C, vitamin E, and glutathione. Both DHLA and lipoic acid also have metal chelating capacities. As a lipoamide, alpha-lipoic acid functions as a cofactor in various multienzyme systems involved in the decarboxylation of alpha-keto acids such as pyruvate \nAlpha-lipoic acid was shown to bring about cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phases in FaDu and Jurkat human tumor cell lines . It was also found to scavenge reactive oxygen species in MCF-7 breast cancer cells . Reduction of reactive oxygen species was then followed by cancer cell growth arrest and apoptosis . In another study, lipoic acid was shown to induce cell death in colorectal cancer cells independent of their p53 status, and to enhance the cytotoxicity of 5-fluorouracil ",

It can be broken down by enzymes in the intestine to produce cyanide, a known poison. It was first used in Europe and later in the United States as an alternative cancer therapy. Promoters claimed that the cyanide released from amygdalin selectively killed cancer cells, leaving normal tissue cells unharmed. When fed to laboratory animals that had cancer cells implanted in them, amygdalin did not reduce the tumor size or slow their growth. In a clinical study, cancer patients using amygdalin did not have any benefits but some showed cyanide toxicity.There is renewed interest in studying amygdalin after the discovery of new anticancer mechanisms. However, cancer patients should not use this product in the current form until more is known about its safety and effectiveness.",

      "Special Point": "The Food and Drug Administration has banned the sale and use of amygdalin (Laetrile®) due to the risk of cyanide poisoning. For this reason, Laetrile® is only offered at alternative medicine clinics outside the United States. Some clinics use it as a component of multi-modality metabolic therapies. Such therapies generally have not been found effective and are discussed at greater length in a separate monograph about metabolic therapies",
      "Brand Name": "Laetrile®, Amigdalina, NovoDalin B17",
      "Scientific Name": "D-mandelonitrile-b-D-glucosido-6-b-D-glucoside",
      "Clinical Summary": "Amygdalin is a naturally occurring cyanogenic glycoside derived from nuts, plants, and the pits of certain fruits, primarily apricots. Bitter almonds containing amygdalin are used in Traditional Chinese Medicine to remove “blood stasis” and to treat abscesses . Amygdalin was first used to treat cancer more than a century ago in Russia and later in the United States. A purified form sold as Laetrile has been a popular alternative cancer therapy since the 1960s. Some claimed amygdalin to be a vitamin (B17) and that deficiencies could cause cancer, but this is not substantiated by scientific evidence . Amygdalin is banned in the United States but it is available in other countries and online.Amygdalin is metabolized by the enzyme beta-glucosidase into benzaldehyde, glucose and cyanide in the intestine . Cyanide from the hydrolysis of amygdalin is believed to be cytotoxic with actions selective against cancerous cells, but results from animal studies were mostly negative . Other animal studies suggest it may help to relieve pain due to its anti-inflammatory  and analgesic effects \nOne study suggested amygdalin can inhibit tumor growth, but subsequent tests were unable to confirm this observation . A clinical trial in the late 1970s supported by the National Cancer Institute did not find amygdalin to be beneficial, and some patients in the study developed cyanide toxicity . A systematic review also concluded that amygdalin is ineffective against cancer With the recent discovery of anticancer properties of amygdalin through previously unknown mechanisms , there is renewed interest in whether this agent may have potential as an anticancer treatment.Amygdalin has severe adverse effects. It should not be used as a therapy in the current form.",
      "Purported Uses2": [
        "Cancer prevention",
        "Cancer treatment"
      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "Amygdalin is metabolized by the enzyme beta-glucosidase, which removes the glucose molecules to form prunasin and mandelonitrile. This is further broken down to benzaldehyde and hydrocyanic acid . When consumed orally, amygdalin is more likely to produce cyanide toxicity, as compared with the injectable form , possibly due to the presence of enzymes from the microflora in the intestine . Cyanide from the hydrolysis of amygdalin is cytotoxic. It was postulated that this action is selective against cancerous cells because normal cells convert the cyanide to benign thiocyanate via rhodanese . This theory has not been proven in humans Amygdalin demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects by promoting the immunomodulating function of Treg cells . In animal studies, amygdalin suppressed prostaglandin E(2) synthesis and nitric oxide production through COX-2 and iNOS inhibition . It reduced inflammation pain by inhibiting tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta) \nAmygdalin exerts neurotrophic effects by activating the extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 pathway Recent studies found amygdalin may have anticancer effects. In animals, amygdalin inhibits the tumor-promoting effect of the Epstein-Barr virus . In human prostate cancer DU145 and LNCaP cells, amygdalin increased pro-apoptotic Bax protein expression and caspase-3 enzyme activity, while decreasing anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein expression . It downregulates cell cycle-related genes in SNU-C4 human colon cancer cells . An in vitro study suggests amygdalin may inhibit growth and proliferation in bladder cancer cell lines by decreasing cell cycle regulatory proteins cdk2 and cyclin A . It also induces growth-regulating protein follistatin expression in human hepatocarcinoma HepG2 cells ",
      "Warnings": "Amygdalin is not approved for use in the United States.\nCases of cyanide toxicity associated with the use of amygdalin have been reported \nContaminated and adulterated products of both injectable and oral forms have been reported ",

It has also demonstrated possible anticancer effects in laboratory studies, but this has not been confirmed in humans.Andrographis paniculata is used in traditional medicine to treat infectious diseases and fevers. Andrographis possesses antibacterial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and immunostimulating properties. Either alone, or in combination with other herbs, andrographis has been shown to reduce the duration and severity of upper respiratory infections such as those associated with the common cold or flu. Andrographis extract may benefit patients with ulcerative colitis. It also reduced symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. However, patients should use caution before using this herb as it may interact with many drugs.",

      "Clinical Summary": "Andrographis paniculata is a bitter tasting annual plant prevalent in much of Asia. It is often used in combination with other herbs in traditional medicine to treat infectious diseases and associated fevers. It is also used in folk medicine to treat snakebites. Andrographis is promoted in supplemental form for cancer prevention, cancer treatment, and to counter the toxicity of chemotherapy in humans. Formulations containing standardized extracts of andrographis are also marketed for colds and flu.\nIn vitro and animal studies indicate that andrographis has antimicrobial , anti-inflammatory , antioxidant ,anticancer  and antimetastatic  properties.\nKan Jang, a standardized extract of Andrographis paniculata and Eleutherococcus senticosus, has been studied in manufacturer-sponsored clinical trials for relief of respiratory symptoms from cold and flu \nAn andrographis extract was found useful in treating the symptoms of upper respiratory infection ; another study found it as effective as mesalamine in treating ulcerative colitis \nAndrographis extracts also reduced rheumatoid factors and relieved rheumatoid arthritis symptoms ",

        "HIV"
      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "The active constituents of andrographis are diterpenoid lactones known as andrographolides . They exhibit anti-inflammatory activity by inhibiting nitric oxide production and cyclooxygenase-2 expression . In mouse hepatocytes, andrographis induced mRNA expression of P450 subfamily members, CYP1A1 and CYP1A2, in a concentration-dependent manner . In other studies, andrographis extract demonstrated a calcium channel inhibition effect that can cause smooth muscle relaxation and a decrease in blood pressure and heart rate , as well as relaxation of uterus . It also showed antiplatelet effects by inhibiting thrombin  and platelet activating factor . When given orally to mice, andrographis extract was shown to neutralize snake venom . In addition, andrographolides inhibit HIV-induced dysregulation of cell cycle and increased CD4+ lymphocyte levels in HIV-1 patients Andrographolides also demonstrate anticancer effects. They inhibited IL-6 expression and IL-6-mediated signals in human prostate cancer cells, and suppressed tumor growth of DU145 human prostate tumors in mice ; inhibited migration and invasion of human colorectal cancer Lovo cells through suppression of mRNA and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-7 protein levels ; and MMP-2 activity in human HT29 colon cancer cells . An in vitro study found that andrographolide reduced the invasiveness of human A549 non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells by suppressing the PI3K/Akt/AP-1 signaling pathway and inhibiting MMP-7 expression . Andrographolides were shown to cause apoptosis of human hepatoma cancer cells through the induction of c-Jun N-terminal kinase  and through the activation of caspases in vitro . They inhibited E-selection expression resulting in the decreased adhesion of gastric cancer cells to endothelial tissues ; and also inhibited tumor cell growth by stimulating cytotoxic T-lymphocyte production through IL-2 and IFN-gamma secretion . An in vitro study found that andrographolide enhanced doxorubicin-induced cell death in several human cancer cell lines, mainly through JAK-STAT suppression ",

      "Scientific Name": "2-amino-5-guanidinovaleric acid",
      "Clinical Summary": "Arginine is an amino acid that is synthesized in the body. Oral arginine has been used for various conditions such as hypertension, angina, atherosclerosis, migraine headache, and erectile dysfunction. Its vasodilatory properties are thought to be responsible for the beneficial effects. Arginine has also been used to enhance wound healing, immune function, and athletic performance.\nSome studies support the use of arginine in coronary artery and peripheral artery diseases (PADs) , but long-term supplementation worsened PAD . Arginine has also been studied for its effect on modifying or preventing the development of nitrate tolerance during continuous transdermal nitroglycerin therapy . Supplementation with arginine, glutamine, and HMB and may benefit vascular endothelial function in older adults , but arginine supplementation did not improve blood flow or muscle performance in older women Along with antioxidant vitamins, arginine reduced preeclampsia incidence in high-risk women , but arginine supplements did not improve blood pressure or kidney function in women with preeclampsia . Large doses of oral arginine improved subjective assessment of sexual function in men with erectile dysfunction . Arginine combined with ibuprofen may increase pain relief in patients with migraine headaches . Arginine supplementation by enteral feeding decreased shock in severely burned patients  and may be useful as adjunctive therapy in patients with active tuberculosis \nArginine supplementation has been studied in cancer patients. Perioperative enteral formulas enhanced with arginine may improve wound healing , enhance immune status , and reduce length of hospital stay . Other results in surgical cancer patients have been mixed . Interestingly, arginine deprivation-based treatments are also being pursued as potential cancer treatments ",

        "Erectile dysfunction",
        "Migraine headaches"
      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "Arginine is unique among amino acids for its vasodilatory properties . Arginine acts as a precursor for the synthesis of endogenous nitric oxide (NO) via the action of nitric oxide synthase (NOS). NO functions as a paracrine-signaling molecule mediating vasodilation and inhibition of platelet activation, monocyte and leucocyte adhesion, and smooth muscle cell proliferation. NO also helps to control vascular oxidative stress and redox-regulated gene expression . Arginine is also needed for the synthesis of creatine which is important in muscle contraction . In colorectal adenoma cells, arginine reduces the expression of survivin, an inhibitor of apoptosis, and induces iNOS expression ",
      "Warnings": "Limited studies suggest that arginine supplementation may increase breast tumor growth, but more research is needed to examine this ",
      "Adverse Reactions": [

      "Clinical Summary": "Arnica is a perennial herb found in East Asia, Europe, the northern United States, and Canada. Its medicinal history dates back several centuries and arnica continues to be popular today. Its flowers and roots have been used to treat bruises, sprains, arthritic pain, and muscle aches. A highly diluted form of Arnica is also used in homeopathic remedies.In vitro studies show that arnica has antimicrobial  and anti-inflammatory  properties. A few clinical trials suggest that topical arnica is helpful for osteoarthritis , and significantly reduces bruising compared with placebo or low-concentration vitamin K ointments . However, a small study reported that topical arnica actually increased pain 24 hours after calf exercises A systematic review of homeopathic arnica studies has previously considered their evidence of effectiveness to be insufficient . More recent studies report reduced postoperative swelling in patients following knee surgery , and reduced pain following tonsillectomy . Rigorous research is needed to determine the clinical benefits of homeopathic arnica.",

        "Skin disorders",
        "Sprains"
      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "Sesquiterpene lactones, the active constituents in arnica, have anti-inflammatory properties and inhibit binding of transcription factors AP-1 and NF-κB to DNA . A tincture prepared from arnica flowers suppressed collagenase-1 (MMP1) and interstitial collagenase-13 (MMP13) mRNA levels in human articular chondrocytes in vitro . MMP13 and MMP1 enzymes are thought to play a significant role in cartilage and joint destruction and inflammation seen in osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Both arnica tinctures and sesquiterpene lactones were found to suppress NF-κB activation and IL-12 production in dendritic cells at high concentrations, but can also have immunostimulatory effects when diluted . Another study found that sesquiterpene lactones inhibit platelet function by interacting with platelet sulfhydryl groups, probably associated with reduced phospholipase A2 activity . In addition to sesquiterpene lactones, the allergenic potential of arnica may be partly due to other allergens such as polyacetylenes ",
      "Warnings": "Oral intake of arnica-containing products can result in serious side effects. The FDA has classified pure arnica as an unsafe herb  and there are associated adverse effects with its use (see below) ",
      "Contraindications": "Surgical procedures: Avoid perioperatively due to antiplatelet effects demonstrated in vitro Open cuts, wounds, broken skin, mucous membranes: Topical arnica should be avoided on these areas.Pregnant and nursing women: Ingestion of arnica tea by a nursing mother caused serious side effects in a newborn Allergies to sunflowers, marigolds, or ragweed: Individuals with allergies to members of the Asteracea family may likely be allergic to arnica.",
      "Adverse Reactions": "The FDA has classified pure arnica as an unsafe herb , and oral intake of arnica has resulted in serious side effects. Topical and homeopathic arnica are generally considered safe, although one report describes an overdose with homeopathic arnica (see below).Case reportsOral, raw herb: Gastrointestinal distress, internal bleeding, tachycardia, dyspnea, and coma Oral, homeopathic overdose: Severe vomiting followed by acute, bilateral vision loss after accidental overdose Oral, infant exposure through breast-milk: Hemolytic anemia in a 9-day-old breastfed infant 48 hours after his mother began drinking an arnica flower tea Topical: Contact dermatitis ",

      "Scientific Name": "Artemisia annua",
      "Clinical Summary": "Commonly known as wormwood or sweet sagewort, Artemisia annua has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for reducing fevers, inflammation, headaches, bleeding and for treating malaria.\nIn vitro studies indicate that artemisinin, the active principle of A. annua, may be an effective treatment for protozoal infections including leishmaniasis , Chagas’ disease, and African sleeping sickness . Systematic reviews of artemisinin show that it is as effective as quinine in treating both uncomplicated and severe malaria . However, increased risk of relapse may limit its uses . It is also unclear whether A. annua is effective against strains of malaria that are resistant to quinine.In one RCT, a low-dose formulation of artemisia produced clinically relevant pain reductions in patients with hip or knee osteoarthritis . A subsesquent open-label continuation study demonstrated long-term safety with maintained improvements at 6 months A. annua has also been investigated for its anticancer properties. Terpenoids and flavonoids isolated from the herb exert cytotoxic effects in several human tumor cell lines . The constituents artemisinin and artesunate have been studied as anticancer treatments . In a recent safety study in advanced breast cancer patients, oral artesunate as add-on therapy was well tolerated, although it was determined that regular audiological assessments should be included to monitor for ototoxicity ",

        "Malaria",
        "Inflammation",

      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "Artemisinin, the active constituent of A. annua, exerts antimalarial effects by free radicals formed via cleavage of the endoperoxide bond in its structure, which are responsible for eradicating the Plasmodium species Artemisinin induces apoptosis and cell cycle arrest of Leishmani donovani promastigotes . It has antiproliferative effects on medullary thyroid carcinoma cells , and induces apoptosis in a lung cancer cell line by modulating p38 and calcium signaling . In another study, it significantly inhibited cell growth and proliferation, and caused G1 cell-cycle arrest in neuroblastoma cell lines . Dihydroartemisinin, a semi-synthetic derivative of artemisinin, demonstrates anti-inflammatory activity by attenuating COX-2 production via downregulation of serine/threonine kinase (AKT) and mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways  . Recent findings suggest that dihydroartemisinin-triggered apoptosis in colorectal cells occurs through the reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated mitochondria-dependent pathway ",

      "Scientific Name": "Withania somnifera",
      "Clinical Summary": "A popular Ayurvedic herb, ashwagandha is often used in formulations prescribed for stress, strain, fatigue, pain, skin diseases, diabetes, gastrointestinal disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and epilepsy . It is also used as a general tonic, to increase energy and improve health and longevity , and topically as an analgesic . The active constituents include alkaloids, steroidal lactones, saponins, and withanolides.\nIn vitro studies suggest that ashwagandha has neuroprotective  and anti-inflammatory properties which may protect against cartilage damage in osteoarthritis . In addition, improvements in hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and insulin sensitivity have been detected in an animal model of type 2 diabetes . Other studies indicate cytotoxic, chemopreventative, immunomodulating , and radiosensitizing effects , and enhancement in chromosomal stability Ashwagandha is rich in iron . Small-scale human studies suggest that it may promote growth in children and improve hemoglobin level and red blood cell count, and improve sexual performance in adults  and also useful in the treatment of male infertility . An herbal tea containing ashwagandha was shown to increase natural killer cell activity in healthy volunteers with recurrent coughs and colds . Data also indicate that ashwagandha may be helpful for anxiety , to affect markers of metabolic syndrome in schizophrenia patients receiving antipsychotic therapy,  and to improve cognitive function in patients with bipolar disorder . In another clinical trial, an herbo-mineral formula containing ashwagandha was shown to benefit osteoarthritis . In a double-blind RCT, a standardized aqueous extract ofroots and leaves produced dose-dependent analgesic, anti-inflammatory and chondroprotective effects in patients with knee joint pain . Preliminary data suggest that ashwagandha may help to improve balance in patients with progressive degenerative cerebral ataxias \nAshwagandha reduced the growth of breast, central nervous system, colon, and lung cancer cells  without affecting normal cells , but did not show any effectiveness against drug-resistant cancer stem cells . The compound Withaferin A enhanced oxaliplatin effects in human pancreatic cancer cells . Ashwagandha was also shown to prevent chemotherapy-induced neutropenia in mice . In a small study of breast cancer patients, it alleviated chemotherapy-induced fatigue and improved quality of life. Larger trials are needed to confirm these observations ",

      "Mechanism of Action": "Alkaloids, steroidal lactones, saponins, and withanolides are thought to be the biologically active components of ashwagandha. Studies have pointed to cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibition as the mechanism for the herb’s anti-arthritic effects. In animal studies, ashwagandha’s anti-inflammatory activity was comparable to hydrocortisone . It exhibits antioxidant effects in the brain, and tranquilizing effects on the central nervous system in animals  possibly by influencing GABA receptor function . Withanolides in the roots and leaves are considered similar to steroids in their biological activities . Triethylene glycol, a compound isolated from the leaves, was identified an active sleep-inducing component in a murine model, and may potentially be used to relieve insomnia Microarray analysis revealed that ashwagandha represses proinflammatory gene expression, including IL-6, IL-1β, IL-8, Hsp70, and STAT-2, and induces p38/MAPK expression in a prostate cancer cell line . Ashwagandha may inhibit tumor growth  and increases cytotoxic T lymphocyte production . In vitro studies have shown that root extracts have cytotoxic properties against lung, colon, central nervous system, and breast cancer cell lines . Withaferin A induces reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and disruption of mitochondrial function in a human leukemia cell line, thereby inducing apoptosis . In estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) and negative (ER-) breast cancer cells, withaferin A induces apoptosis and decreased tumor size . Apoptosis of cancer cells by withanone is mediated through p53 . Withianone also exerts anticancer activity by binding to the TPX2-Aurora A Complex . Other studies show ashwagandha’s cytotoxicity is related to its structure; it enhances ATPase and inhibits succinate dehydrogenase activities, impairing oxidative phosphorylation.In animal studies, ashwagandha enhanced the effects of radiation therapy  by reducing tumor GSH levels . It was also shown to reverse paclitaxel-induced neutropenia in mice No significant interactions have been reported between ashwagandhaand either CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 enzymes in human liver microsomes ",

      "How It Works": "Astragalus has immune-stimulating effects and may help to reduce side effects from chemotherapy, but it has not been shown to treat or prevent cancer.Astragalus root belongs to a group of medicinal plants from the legume family. It has a long history of use in traditional Chinese medicine for a variety of conditions, and as a tonic to increase stamina.Astragalus works by stimulating several factors of the immune system. However, this property may also reduce the intended effects of certain drugs used to suppress the immune function. In addition, a compound in astragalus may have hormonal effects, and it is unknown whether this characteristic may change the effectiveness of some cancer treatments. So even though lab and population studies suggest astragalus might reduce chemotherapy-associated side effects, this has not been studied well enough. Clinical trials are needed to determine the circumstances under which astragalus can safely be used along with standard cancer treatments.",

      "Clinical Summary": "Astragalus belongs to a group of medicinal plants from the Leguminosae family. The root of A. membranaceus has a long history of use in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), and is often used along with other herbs as a tonic to increase stamina, strength, and vitality. Extracts of astragalus are sold as dietary supplements to improve immune function and to decrease fatigue. Polysaccharides and triterpenoid saponin compounds isolated from astragalus have been used in scientific research.Astragalus and its constituents have antioxidant , anti-inflammatory , and antiviral  activities. In vitro and animal studies suggest protective effects on the heart , kidney , bones  , and the nervous system Clinical studies of astragalus in humans showed promising results. A case report suggests it may reduce proteinuria associated with idiopathic membranous nephropathy . In small studies of healthy individuals, astragalus exhibited sodium-excreting properties  and produced a viral-type immune response . A formula containing astragalus as a major ingredient reduced fatigue in athletes . When used as an injection, astragalus appeared to benefit patients with IgA nephropathy . Astragalus used in Chinese medicine helped reduce diabetic ketoacidosis . In a small study of dialysis patients, an astragalus-based TCM formula significantly preserved residual renal function Anticancer properties have been observed in vitro with some compounds from astragalus against gastric , colon , and hepatic  cancers. Astragalus has also been associated with prolonged survival times in acute myeloid leukemia patients Data also suggest beneficial effects when used with chemotherapy . In vitro, concomitant treatment with aldesleukin and astragalus potentiated tumoricidal activity while decreasing side effects . It also enhanced platinum-based chemotherapy  and protected against oxaliplatin neurotoxicity . Astragalus saponins reversed toxicities of fluorouracil  and augmented the therapeutic benefit of vinblastine while reducing neutropenic and anemic effects in vivo . An injectable form of astragalus with vinorelbine and cisplatin improved quality of life in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer , but whether orally administered astragalus would exert the same effects is unknown. In another study, an astragalus extract helped to manage cancer-related fatigue . Meta-analyses identified astragalus as among the traditional medicines associated with reductions in chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting , and to have benefits in patients with hepatocellular cancers , but larger well-designed trials to confirm these findings are needed.Although astragalus is generally safe, it may interact with certain drugs. Because this botanical  and its constituents have demonstrated antioxidant  and estrogenic  activities, it may interfere with some chemotherapy drugs and/or affect hormone-sensitive cancers. More studies are needed to determine the circumstances under which astragalus could be useful as an adjuvant therapy to standard cancer treatments.",

      "Mechanism of Action": "Polysaccharides, triterpenoid saponins, and flavonoids are the main constituents of astragalus with immunomodulating, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer effects In vitro studies suggest the saponin astragaloside I promotes osteoblastic differentiation by regulating the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway . Cardioprotective effects from astragaloside IV may occur via the notch1/hes1 signaling pathway . In addition, it augments fibrinolytic potential via increases in tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) synthesis and downregulation of PA inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) . Other anticoagulant activities are attributed to upregulation of KLF2 mRNA expression and inhibition of NF-kB signaling pathway Polysaccharides isolated from astragalus produce immunomodulating effects via activation of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-related mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activities . In murine models, they reduced colitis via inhibition of NOD-like receptor protein 3 inflammasome, which decreases inflammatory factors such as interleukin (IL)-18 and IL-1beta , and reduced multiorgan iron overload via upregulated hepcidin and IL-6 expression and enhanced p38 MAPK phosphorylation . Cardioprotective effects with this constituent were attributed to anti-inflammatory properties and improved balance between reactive oxygen species (ROS) and NO In a diabetic rat model, astragalus polysaccharides exerted effects on glucose and lipid metabolism and insulin resistance Benefits to counteract memory disorders were seen with astragalus due to its activity as a nerve-growth promoting factor  and by its ability to increase M-cholinergic receptor density in senile rats In dialysis patients, an astragalus-based TCM formula enhanced NO production and transforming growth factor beta suppression . In IgA nephropathy patients, an astragalus injection decreased Core I β3-Gal-T-specific molecular chaperone (Cosmc) gene expression and increased IgA1 O-glycosylation levels . In healthy individuals, a sublingual/ingested astragalus root extract produced increases in monocytes, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and platelets, as well as circulating cytokines levels, and self-reported symptoms similar to viral type immune responses such as fatigue, malaise, and headache . In another study, a formula containing astragalus reduced fatigue in athletes by increasing the uptake and utility of oxygen Mechanisms by which astragalus and its constituents may exert anticancer effects have also been examined. In human colorectal cancers cell lines, astragalus suppressed chromosome organization, histone modification, and regulation of macromolecule metabolism, as well as several cancer signaling pathways . Saponins induced S phase and G2/M arrest and suppressed p21 expression and cyclin-dependent kinase activity . Modulation of mTOR signaling and COX2 downregulation also occurred, which in turn can reduce VEGF levels to suppress angiogenesis . In gastric adenocarcinoma cells, caspase 3 activation, G2/M phase cell cycle arrest, cyclin B1, p21 and c-myc regulation, and downregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 occurred . Combined with vinblastine, saponins boosted downregulation of proangiogenic and proliferative factors while attenuating neutropenia and anemia seen with this chemotherapy . In combination with calpain inhibitors, these saponins may also exert more pronounced apoptotic effects . Polysaccharides potentiate immune-mediated antitumor activity of interleukin-2 in vitro , improve lymphocyte responses, enhance natural killer cell activity, potentiate monocyte activity , and increase phagocytosis perhaps by regulating tumor necrosis factor production . Apoptotic effects by polysaccharides in hepatocellular carcimona cells were attributed to decreased Notch1 expression Formononetin derived from astragalus was shown to have estrogen-receptor-modulating effects .

      "How It Works": "Avlimil has been shown in a small unpublished study to improve sexual function in normal women.\nAvlimil is a dietary supplement that contains sage leaf, red raspberry leaf, kudzu root extract, red clover extract, capsicum pepperlicorice root, bayberry fruit, damiana leaf,valerian root, ginger root, and black cohosh root. It is being promoted to relieve symptoms of female sexual dysfunction. Sexual dysfunction may involve loss of sexual desire, arousal, difficulty in maintaining arousal, painful intercourse, or difficulty in achieving orgasm. This may result from factors such as stress, hormonal imbalances, use of antidepressants, menopause, and cancer treatments. The manufacturer claims that use of Avlimil results in improved sexual response. The herbal components of Avlimil are thought to enhance sexual satisfaction by increasing blood flow to the sex organs and by promoting muscle relaxation.A small unpublished study showed that Avlimil had a positive effect on sexual response in normal women. Avlimil has not been studied in cancer patients.",
      "Purported Uses": "Female Sexual Dysfunction:\nOne unpublished study showed that Avlimil can improve sexual function in women when compared to placebo.",
      "Patient Warnings": "Sexual dysfunction could be a result of other complex underlying physical, biological, or psychological disorders. Patients should consult and be monitored by a physician when using this product..\nThe Federal Trade Commission charged the marketers of Avlimil in making false and unsubstantiated claims.

It consists of sage leaf, red raspberry leaf, kudzu root extract, red clover extract, capsicum pepper, licorice root, bayberry fruit, damiana leaf, valerian root, ginger root, and black cohosh root. Sexual dysfunction may involve loss of sexual desire, difficulty in maintaining arousal, painful intercourse, or difficulty in achieving orgasm. It may result from factors such as stress, hormonal imbalances, cancer treatment involving surgery, radiation, chemotherapy or hormone therapy, use of antidepressants, or menopause. Avlimil is thought to enhance sexual satisfaction by increasing blood flow and by promoting muscle relaxation. Some of the components may improve circulation.\nResults from in vitro and in vivo assays showed that Avlimil exhibits both estrogenic (at low concentration) and antiestrogenic (at higher concentrations) effects in a dose dependent manner . A small unpublished clinical trial involving 49 women found Avlimil to have a positive effect on sexual response . However, the ingredients in the commercial product are different from those used in the study \nAvlimil has not been studied in cancer patients. Since this product contains botanical ingredients that have estrogenic effects, it is not appropriate for patients with hormone sensitive cancers.",
      "Purported Uses2": [

      "Mechanism of Action": "The herbs sage, kudzu, red cloverlicorice, and black cohosh that are present in Avlimil have estrogenic effects and have been used for relief of menopausal symptoms. Damiana leaf is purported to be an aphrodisiac but scientific proof is lacking. Capsaicin, a component of capsicum, can cause depolarization of C-fiber polymodal nociceptors and release of substance P which can heighten sensitivity . Manufacturers of Avlimil claim that the herbal components improve circulation that leads to increased blood flow to the genital tissue and also help muscle relaxation.",

The effects of meditation in reducing anxiety, lowering blood pressure, and enhancing general well-being have also been confirmed.\nA few Ayurvedic herbs are being investigated for their anticancer potential. Curcumin is among the extensively studied, and initial findings appear promising. Yoga has been shown to help improve sleep pattern in lymphoma patients , and also reduces symptoms of stress in breast and prostate cancer patients ",

      "Mechanism of Action": "Ayurveda emphasizes both health maintenance (Svasthavritha), and diagnosis and treatment (Athuravritha). Patients are classified by their prominent dosha, or physical, emotional, and metabolic type, KaphaPitta, or Vata, each located in specific organs and associated with two of the five elements (earth, fire, water, air, and ether) and five senses. The doshas represent properties shared by the organs, body, environment and cosmos. When a patient’s unique state of dosha is out of balance, illness occurs. Therapy is personalized to the individual’s problems and metabolic characteristics to restore balance through diet and lifestyle modifications, medicinals (herbs, spices, metals and/or animal products), breathing exercises, and meditation. Detoxification (panchakarma) occurs before administration of medicines, which includes bloodletting, induced vomiting, and bowel purging. The therapeutic approach seeks to cure disease by reversing the steps that led to it (e.g., administering cooling medicines if Pitta, the hot dosha, is predominant) Maharasnadi Quathar, a medicinal used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, increases antioxidant enzyme activity, decreases TBARS generation, and improves symptoms in human subjects . Many of the more frequently used herbs, such as ashwagandha (Withania somniferaguggul (Commiphora mukul Boswellia Boswellia serratagotu kola (Centella asiaticacurcumin (Curcuma longaginger (Zingiber officinalealoe (Aloe barbadensis), and garlic (Allium sativum), have been studied extensively in vitro and in vivo and show antioxidant, antitumor, antimicrobial, immunomodulatory, or anti-inflammatory properties. The herbs most often used to treat diabetes, Gymnema sylvestre,Momordica charantia, fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum)Coccinia indica, and Pterocarpus marsupium, show hypoglycemic activity in vitro and in vivo. Mucuna pruriens, used in preparations for Parkinson’s disease, contains L-dopa Rasayana herbs (said to promote positive health) such as ashwagandha, Asparagus racemosusEmblica officinalisPiper longum, and Terminalia chebula showed immunostimulant and adaptogenic activities in an animal study . Ayurvedic gold preparations (e.g., Swarna Bhasma) have antioxidant and restorative effects in animal models of ischemia . The herbal mixtures Maharishi Amrit Kalash-4 and -5 have antioxidant properties, inhibit LDL oxidation in vitro, inhibit platelet aggregation, and cause a reduction in aortic arch atheroma in hyperlipidemic rabbits An in vitro study investigated the activity of extracts from eight plants that are traditionaly used as immunomodulators in Ayurvedic medicine against HIV: Allium sativum, Asparagus racemosus, Coleus forskohlii, Emblica officinalis, Glycyrrhiza glabra, Piper longum, Tinospora cordifolia and Withania somnifera. The study found that these extracts significantly reduced viral production in human lymphoid CEM-GFP cells infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-INL4).",
      "Warnings": [
        "Although heavy metals such as lead, gold, and silver are traditionally used in ayurvedic formulations, the use of lead for its assumed benefit has been a cause of concern. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 12 cases of lead poisoning associated with the use of Ayurvedic medications",
        "In the last few decades, commercialized meditation regimens have emerged to the concern of many. They often associate meditation with supernatural abilities. Such claims are not based on scientific evidence and should not be confused with meditation practice in Ayurveda.",

      "How It Works": "Beta-carotene is not effective in treating heart disease, cancer, or HIV or preventing cataracts or macular degeneration.\nBeta-carotene is an antioxidant that is found in yellow and orange fruits, such as apricots, cantaloupe, and papaya, as well as squash, carrots, sweet potatoes, pumpkin, leafy greens, and broccoli. Although scientists have proposed a number of mechanisms by which beta-carotene obtained through a healthy diet may prevent cancer, current evidence does not support supplementation.",

          "To prevent cancer",
          "Several large and well-designed clinical trials do not support the use of beta carotene supplements for preventing cancer. In fact, high beta-carotene intake has been linked to higher risk of lung cancer in male smokers and aggressive prostate cancer. (This does not necessarily apply to beta carotene obtained from the diet. Beta carotene may act in conjunction with other phytochemicals in fruits and vegetables)."
        ],
        [
          "To prevent and treat heart disease",
          "Several large and well-designed clinical trials and population studies show that taking beta-carotene supplements does not reduce the risk of myocardial infarction (heart attack), angina, or coronary artery disease. In fact, a review of clinical trials showed that beta-carotene was associated with a small increase in overall death as well as death to cardiovascular disease."
        ],
        [
          "To prevent cataracts",
          "Clinical trials generally have shown that taking beta-carotene supplements does not reduce the risk of developing cataracts, but a small clinical study found that amounts of beta-carotene in the blood were associated with decreased cataracts, indicating that beta-carotene obtained from the diet, but not supplements may be helpful."
        ],
        [
          "To treat HIV and AIDS",
          "Although a few small studies suggested that beta-carotene supplements could increase CD4 cell counts, recent clinical trials have not been able to replicate these results."
        ],
        [
          "To stimulate the immune system",
          "Some laboratory experiments show that beta-carotene stimulates certain aspects of the immune system, but it is not certain that this effect occurs in the human body. No clinical trials have tested this use in healthy volunteers."
        ],
        [
          "To prevent and treat macular degeneration",
          "One clinical trial suggested that taking an antioxidant supplement plus zinc reduces the risk of macular degeneration, but it is not clear whether beta-carotene, or any of the other antioxidants in this supplement, were responsible for these effects."
        ],
        [
          "To treat oral leukoplakia",

        [
          "To treat type 2 diabetes",
          "One clinical study found that high serum beta-carotene levels decreased risk of developing type 2 diabetes, but another study found that beta-carotene supplements did not reduce the risk for type 2 diabetes. Further studies of dietary beta-carotene are needed."

        [
          "To improve cognition",
          "Results from a clinical trial suggest that long-term supplementation with beta-carotene may improve cognition; however, because of the possible health risks associated with beta-carotene supplementation, further studies are needed to determine if dietary beta-carotene could also improve cognition."

      "Do Not Take If": [
        "You regularly consume alcohol (Alcohol may reduce its effects, and high doses of beta-carotene can increase the toxic effects that alcohol has on the liver.)"

      ],
      "Special Point": [
        "In general, high dietary intake of fruit and vegetables is associated with reduced risks of cancer and heart disease. Although beta-carotene supplements do not appear to prevent or effectively treat either of these diseases, beta-carotene obtained from the diet may be more beneficial. This is because it may interact with other phytochemicals in fruits and vegetables and have a greater effect on the body than do supplements alone."
      ],
      "Clinical Summary": "A natural pigment synthesized by plants, beta-carotene is used as an antioxidant and an immunostimulant, and to prevent or treat cancer, HIV, heart disease, and leukoplakia. Beta-carotene, along with alpha-carotene and beta-cryptoxanthin, can be converted to retinol and is classified as a provitamin A carotenoid. Supplementation with beta-carotene does not increase overall vitamin A levels or lead to vitamin A toxicity. Animal studies show that beta-carotene promotes the development of pulmonary adenocarcinoma via increased cAMP signaling Available data concerning beta-carotene supplementation for HIV-positive patients and its effects on CD4 counts  as well as cardiovascular disease are conflicting. A meta-analysis of eight randomized trials demonstrated a small but significant increase in all-cause mortality and cardiovascular death for the beta-carotene arm over placebo , whereas other studies have reported no benefits of beta-carotene supplementation on cardiovascular disease  or its risk factors \nConsistent associations between serum beta-carotene levels and risk of developing type 2 diabetes are also lacking . One study reported that serum beta-carotene was inversely associated with the incidence of cataract formation \nLong-term beta-carotene supplementation may increase cognitive function \nEpidemiological associations between beta-carotene and cancer risk are conflicting. Whereas high dietary beta-carotene intake was associated with reduced risk of cervical cancer , high serum levels were also associated with increased risk for aggressive prostate cancer  but decreased the risk of aggressive urothelial cell carcinoma . In addition, studies of beta-carotene supplementation and chemoprevention for cancer are inconsistent. Studies show that consumption of beta carotene, vitamins A, C, fruits and vegetables does not influence the risk of renal cell carcinoma . A review of 14 clinical trials shows that supplementation with antioxidants, beta-carotene and vitamins A, C, and E, does not prevent gastrointestinal cancer, and that  beta-carotene may actually increase overall mortality . Data from large, multicenter trials suggest that beta-carotene supplementation may not lower the risk of prostate cancer , and in male smokers over the age 40, it may increase lung cancer incidence . Beta-carotene supplementation especially when combined with cigarette smoking may also reduce the efficacy of cancer therapies, resulting in increased recurrence and mortality . A large-scale cohort study in the Netherlands suggests alcohol consumption has a negative effect on the chemopreventive property of beta-carotene The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends against beta-carotene or vitamin E supplements for the prevention of cardiovascular disease or cancer ",
      "Food Sources": "Deep yellow and orange fruits (apricots, cantaloupe, papaya), squash, carrots, sweet potatoes, pumpkin, leafy greens, and broccoli ",
      "Purported Uses2": [

        "Immunostimulation",
        "Macular degeneration",
        "Oral leukoplakia"
      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "Beta-carotene has strong antioxidant effects. It protects lipid peroxidation and provitamin-A activity, thereby preventing oxidative damage . It was also shown to alleviate the severity of ulcerative colitis in mice by modulating several molecular targets including nuclear factor-kappa B, cyclooxygenase-2, interleukin 17, and connective tissue growth factor In other studies, beta-carotene reduced cell growth and induced apoptosis in a variety of cancer cell lines possibly through caveolin-1 expression . In vivo studies suggest that beta-carotene induces glutathione production . Beta-carotene may enhance macrophage function and natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity and increase T-helper lymphocyte counts. However, recent clinical studies suggest that beta-carotene can increase cancer risk, and in vitro studies have shown that beta-carotene induces angiogenic gene expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) as well as HUVEC migration . Furthermore, beta carotene stimulated cellular proliferation in a pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cell line  and in lung cancer cells ",
      "Adverse Reactions": "Toxicity: Carotenodermia is a harmless but clearly documented effect of high carotenoid intake. A yellowish discoloration of the skin resulted following chronic intake of food and supplements containing large amounts of carotenoids ",
      "Herb-Drug Interactions": "Ethanol: Hepatotoxic effects of ethanol may be potentiated by high doses of beta-carotene. A large-scale cohort study in the Netherlands found that alcohol consumption has a negative effect on the chemopreventive property of beta-carotene.",

      "Clinical Summary": "Beta-elemene is a volatile terpene found in celery, mint, and in several other herbs used in traditional medicine. Whereas the purified form is generally not used as a dietary supplement because of poor absorption, many patients consume herbs high in beta-elemene in belief that they help cure cancer.\nIn vitro studies show anti-proliferative effects of beta-elemene in various cancer cells through cell-cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis . It also enhanced the activity of cisplatin against prostate cancer cells . The parenteral form of beta-elemene isolated from Rhizoma zedoariae, a species of ginger, has been studied in Asia and is reported to relieve pain, decrease the side effects of chemotherapy, and increase the quality of life in cancer patients. However, human trials conducted so far are of poor quality \nA systematic review indicates that beta-elemene injection may improve effectiveness of chemotherapy for the treatment of lung cancer . However, controlled trials are needed to confirm this observation.",

      "Mechanism of Action": "In an erythroleukemic cell line, beta-elemene inhibited telomerase activity, which was enhanced in combination with cyclophosphamide . It also demonstrated anti-fibrotic effects, inducing decreases in plasma angiotensin II levels and angiotensin II receptor type 1 expression, reducing collagen formation in a liver fibrosis rat model . Beta-elemene also exhibits anti-inflammatory effects, with reduction in LPS-induced nitric oxide production and prostaglandin E2 by rat peritoneal macrophages \nBeta-elemene has been shown to affect cancer cells via different mechanisms. In an in vitro study, following administration of beta-elemene, leukemia cells were arrested in S/G2 phase and underwent apoptosis . The antiproliferative effects were dependent on p38 MAPK activation/phosphorylation, cell cycle arrest in G0/G1, and inhibition of tumor growth of glioblastoma cells . Beta-elemene also induced G2/M arrest in lung carcinoma cells and ovarian cancer cells by combined reduction of cell-cycle promoters Cdc2 and cyclin B1, and elevated cell cycle regulators p53 and p27 . Derivatives of beta-elemene showed antiproliferative activity in human cervical carcinoma cells through a decrease in cell cycle protein Cyclin D1 and thus cell cycle suppression . Furthermore, beta-elemene may enhance the effects of chemotherapy and radiation. In non-small cell lung cancer cells, apoptosis was induced by increased expression of Bax and p-Bcl-2, decreased Bcl-2 and XIAP, and augmented cisplatin-induced increases in caspase activity . In another study, apoptosis response to the taxanes paclitaxel and docetaxel in lung carcinoma cells was enhanced with beta-elemene, through increases in cytochrome c, caspase activity, downregulation of Bcl-2, and altered cell membrane permeability . Beta-elemene combined with radiation induced apoptosis in lung adenocarcinoma cells, possibly by sensitizing cancer cells to radiation \nAn in vivo study showed that beta-elemene inhibits growth of lung cancer cells, and up-regulates the expression of the tumor suppressor, P53, and the release of exosome . Another proposed mechanism is that beta-elemene reverses the resistance of lung cancer cells to cisplatin via the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway ",

There is insufficient evidence to support its other uses.Compounds in bilberry called anthocyanins can regenerate rhodopsin, a pigment found in retinal cells responsible for eyesight. This is one of the reasons it has gained popularity in traditional medicine to support eye health.In laboratory studies, bilberry reduces inflammation and fluid accumulation in tissues, acts as an antioxidant, inhibits blood clotting, and strengthens the walls of blood vessels. Bilberry extracts can inhibit the growth of cancer cells in the lab. Initial studies in humans also show that bilberry may have anti-cancer effects, relieve certain types of inflammation, or improve the biological profiles of those at higher risk for heart disease or diabetes.

      "Clinical Summary": "Bilberry fruit grows on perennial fruit trees or shrubs, and is closely related to the huckleberry and blueberry. It is marketed as a dietary supplement to help improve eyesight and promote overall eye health, and is widely used in herbal therapy. The anthocyanins in bilberry are thought to regenerate rhodopsin, a pigment present in retinal photoreceptor cells.In vitro, bilberry polyphenols appear to protect against neurodegenerative processes and eye disorders . Animal models suggest bilberry extract may help visual functioning  and protect against retinal diseases . Human studies are mixed on whether bilberry anthocyanosides improve visual acuity, night vision, or retinal function  ; many of the positive studies are poorly designed . A small trial suggests bilberry may improve visual function in some individuals with normal tension glaucoma , but generally human data on bilberry for eye disorders are lacking In other studies, a standardized bilberry extract was shown to reduce disease activity in patients with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis . Dietary bilberry produced beneficial changes in serum lipids and lipoproteins in women with higher metabolic risk, but had an unexpected opposite effect in those who were at low risk . Another species of bilberry, Caucasian whortleberry, was found to improve glycemic control in type 2 diabetic patients . Ingestion of bilberries in a diet that also included whole grain/low-insulin-response grain products and fatty fish altered lipid profiles and improved glucose metabolism in individuals at high risk for type 2 diabetes . Two small randomized trials suggest that bilberry juice may reduce biomarkers of inflammation and improve cardiometabolic risk In vitro and in vivo studies indicate that bilberry may have anticancer activities . A pilot study suggests that bilberry extract may significantly reduce proliferation of colorectal cancer cells . Bilberry extract also showed a protective effect against chemotherapy-induced oral mucositis in an animal model . Other small studies of a proprietary extract combination that includes bilberry suggests it may relieve chemotherapy-induced mucositis in cancer patients . However, it is unclear the extent to which bilberry itself may be responsible for such effects. More studies are needed to determine what benefits are attributable to bilberry fruit, as well as its potential synergy with other berry compounds and food combinations.",

      "Mechanism of Action": "In vitro, bilberry polyphenols inhibited amyloid fibril formation and dissolved preformed toxic aggregates and mature fibrils, suggesting a role in controlling fibril formations of various proteins that occur with neurodegenerative diseases . Bilberry anthocyanins modulated oxidative stress defense enzymes heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and glutathione S-transferase-pi (GST-pi) in human retinal pigment epithelial cells . In vitro and in vivo, bilberry inhibited angiogenesis through inhibition of ERK 1/2 and Akt phosphorylation . In an animal model of uveitis and retinal inflammation, pretreatment with a bilberry extract prevented photoreceptor impairment, relieved intracellular ROS elevation, activated retinal NF-ĸB in the inflamed retina, and suppressed the decrease of rhodopsin via inhibition of IL-6, which activates STAT3, thereby protecting outer segment length in photoreceptor cells . In a monocytic cell line, quercetin, epicatechin, and resveratrol inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced NF-kappaB activation In individuals with hypercholesterolemia, anthocyanins may improve endothelium-dependent vasodilation by activating the NO-cGMP signaling pathway . The polyphenols in bilberry juice can modulate inflammation by decreasing plasma C-reactive protein, interleukin (IL)-6, -15, and monokine induced by INFγ (MIG) In human colon and liver cancer cell lines, bilberry anthocyanins demonstrated intracellular antioxidant activity even though concentrations applied were very low . Bilberry extract inhibited human leukemia, colon, and breast cancer cells through apoptotic induction and/or inhibition of cell proliferation . Delphinidin and other anthocyanidins synergistically enhanced cell-cycle arrest and apoptotic induction in aggressive non-small-cell lung cancer cells by modulating Notch, WNT, and NF-ĸB signaling pathways ",
      "Adverse Reactions": "Case report\nRectal bleeding following long-term overconsumption of bilberry has been reported in a 77-year-old man on warfarin therapy, requiring two emergency room visits, treatment with fresh plasma infusions, and hospitalization to evaluate inconsistent international normalized ratio (INR) values ",

This is based on unproven idea that unhealthy cells or organs emit altered electromagnetic waves and that changing these waves back to normal will heal the body. The electronic devices are often promoted for treating cancer. None of the claims made by the promoters have been proven.The American Cancer Society urges cancer patients not to seek treatment with bioresonance or other electronic devices.",

      "Clinical Summary": "Bioresonance therapy, available in clinics in Europe, Mexico, Florida and elsewhere in the U.S., is used to diagnose and treat cancer, allergies, arthritis, and chronic degenerative diseases. A variation known as electrodermal testing was developed as an aid in prescribing homeopathic remedies, and is used in Europe for the diagnosis of allergies. Bioresonance therapy is based on the claim that electromagnetic oscillations emitted by diseased organs and cancer cells vary from those emitted by healthy cells due to their differences in cell metabolism and DNA damage. No evidence supports these claims. Treatment may involve removal and replacement of dental alloys or amalgams, which are said to carry currents that “alter the body’s electromagnetic circulatory system.”\nA randomized trial of bioresonance for the treatment of atopic dermatitis in children showed no efficacy . Clinical trials evaluating electrodermal testing show no reliability in diagnosing allergies \nThe Food and Drug Administration has prosecuted numerous purveyors of electrical devices for making unsubstantiated health benefit claims .

      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "Bioresonance is based upon the unproved premise that electromagnetic oscillations emitted by damaged organs and cancer cells vary from those emitted by healthy cells due to their differences in cell metabolism and DNA damage. An electrical device supposedly detects these differences and can determine which organs are affected and “cancel out” their diseased signal via destructive wave interference \nElectrodermal testing developed as an aid in prescribing homeopathic remedies; medicines are tested “to determine how well they resonate with the individual or how similar they are to the body frequencies needing enhancement to overcome an illness.” Practitioners claim the wave emission from homeopathic medicines or allergens is measured through the device and is modulated through the patient’s autonomic nervous system, influencing skin resistance . No evidence supports any of these claims.\nSome proponents claim the device naturally kills tumor cells by releasing “suppressed” tumor suppressor genes or attenuating overactive oncogenes. This hypothesis is untenable because of the irreversibility of most cancer-causing genetic mutations. An evaluation of one device found that a galvanic skin response of low resistance was not a reliable indicator of vertebral pathology, and that the device produced a low-resistance reading after 5 seconds of application to any point on the body ",

      "How It Works": "Biotin is widely available in foods. Biotin supplements are used to promote nail, skin, and hair health. Some people also use it for nerve, muscle, and diabetic symptoms. Patients should discuss use of this supplement beforehand with their doctor.Biotin is an important coenzyme involved in sugar and fat metabolism. It is found in a variety of foods such as meat, vegetables, and eggs, and is also made in the intestines by bacteria.Some studies show that taking biotin can benefit patients with multiple sclerosis or may improve diabetic nerve pain. Patients with diabetes may have a greater chance of being biotin-deficient. Consuming large amounts of egg whites or taking epilepsy drugs may also lead to biotin deficiency. However, there is no evidence for using biotin supplements in general, and deficiency in this nutrient is otherwise quite rare. In addition, too much biotin may weaken immune response and reduce the number of white blood cells. It may also cause inaccurate lab test results. Therefore, patients should consult with their doctor to determine the source of a true deficiency, or to discuss proper use of this supplement.",
      "Purported Uses": [
        "To treat multiple sclerosis\n\tPreliminary data from a long-term study suggests that biotin is safe and may reduce symptoms in some patients. However, this study is ongoing and the final result is still not known.",

      "Scientific Name": "Cis-hexahydro-2-oxo-1H-thieno[3,4-d]-imidazole-4-valeric acid",
      "Clinical Summary": "Biotin is an essential B vitamin that acts as an important coenzyme in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. It is often taken alone or in combination with other vitamins for skin, nail, and hair health. It is also thought to help diabetes and neuromuscular disorders.Biotin supplementation may be effective in strengthening brittle nails.  Low serum biotin levels have been associated with hair loss in women . There are preliminary data suggesting that high-doses of biotin may decrease symptoms of multiple sclerosis . Biotin may benefit patients with severe diabetic peripheral neuropathy . When taken with chromium, it may improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes . There are reports that biotin can reduce skin rash from gefitinib or erlotinib , but it did not reduce seborrheic dermatitis in infants . More studies are needed to confirm these observations.Biotin is abundant in foods including meat, vegetables, and eggs. True deficiency is rare but can be caused by a genetic disorder  or by malabsorption syndromes. Long-term use of certain anticonvulsant drugs can also induce biotin deficiency , but many of these conditions can be treated by biotin supplementation. Some cancer patients take biotin during chemotherapy. However, there is not enough evidence to show that it is effective in preventing or treating chemotherapy-induced hair loss.Although biotin is generally safe, there are reports of interference with lab assays when taken in high doses ",

      "Mechanism of Action": "Biotin is an essential part of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism via carboxylase. It is converted into the free active form by the enzyme biotinidase, and can be synthesized in the intestine by bacteria Biotin induces microtubule formation in neurons , and biotin deficiency slows myelination  which may result in neuropathy. Biotin may reduce the activity of interleukins and interferons, and reduce the number of leukocytes ",

These experiments show that these substances act in the same way as insulin, by increasing the entry of glucose into cells and promoting its processing and storage in the liver, muscle, and fat. Bitter melon also prevents the conversion of stored nutrients to glucose and the release of this glucose into the blood. However, researchers have not established the correct dosage of bitter melon for effectively treating the high blood glucose levels in diabetes, and therefore it cannot be recommended as a replacement therapy for insulin or hypoglycemic drugs.\nBitter melon extracts were shown to kill leukemia cells in the laboratory and slow the growth of breast cancer in mice, but it is unknown whether these effects occur in humans.

It is used both as food and in medicine to treat diabetes, cancer, viral infections, and immune disorders. Its bitterness is attributed to the presence of alkaloids, momordicosides, and momordicines.\nIn vitro and animal studies indicate anticancer , antiviral  and lipid lowering  effects.\nBitter melon was also shown to exert hypoglycemic effects in both healthy and diabetic patients , but further studies are required to recommend its use . Recent findings suggest that bitter melon extracts have the potential for increasing insulin sensitivity in patients with type-2 diabetes compared to those with type-1 disease Bitter melon had no effect on natural killer cell activity in a study of cervical cancer patients Although bitter melon is consumed as food, consumption of the seeds, extracts, and large quantities of juice can cause adverse effects. It can interact with certain drugs including chemotherapy agents such as vinblastine and paclitaxel , and can lower blood sugar levels when combined with insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents.",

        "Fever",
        "HIV and AIDS",

      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "In an animal model, bitter melon extract showed hypoglycemic activity by suppressing the enzymes glucose-6-phosphatase and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase in the liver . It improved insulin sensitivity, glucose tolerance and insulin signaling . It also reduced insulin resistance by influencing peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) alpha and PPAR gamma expression  and by modulating the phosphorylation status of insulin receptor and its downstream signaling molecules . A recent stugy showed that the preventive effects of bitter melon against insulin resistance are via modulation of nuclear factor (NF-kappa B) and phospho-c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathways \nBitter melon may help weight loss by reducing lipogenesis in adipose tissue. Animals that were fed with bitter melon showed lower fatty acid synthase . Bitter melon also affects fat and carbohydrate metabolism by stimulating thyroid hormones and adiponectin, and by enhancing the activity of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) . In another study, it was shown to prevent inflammation and oxidative stress, modulate mitochondrial activity, suppress apoptosis activation, and inhibit lipid accumulation during the development of fatty liver Bitter melon displays cytotoxic activity: A ribosome inhibiting protein (RIP) MCP30 has been shown to inhibit histone deacetylase-1 (HDAC-1) activity and induce apoptosis in prostate cancer cells . In another study, a triterpene extracted from bitter melon activated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) gamma and induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells . Bitter melon juice also caused apoptosis by inducing caspase-3 activation through adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in pancreatic cell lines . Similar effects were observed with methanol extracts which increase Bax and decrease the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 . Other studies demonstrated reduction in metastasis via suppression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 enzymatic activities in lung adenocarcinoma CL1 cells . Bitter melon juice was found effective in decreasing phosphorylation of the protein kinases Akt and ERK1/2, and viability of gemcitabine-resistant pancreatic cancer cells \nMAP30, a ribosome inhibiting protein (RIP) isolated from bitter melon seeds, inhibits HIV-1 integrase and inactive DNA topology , leading to poor viral DNA integration ",

      "How It Works": "There is some evidence that black cohosh is effective for menopausal symptoms. More research is needed.\nIt is not clear if black cohosh is beneficial for menopausal symptoms due to conflicting results from various studies. There is not enough evidence to support its anticancer effects in humans. Patients should use caution because liver failure has been reported from use of black cohosh.",
      "Purported Uses": [
        [
          "Menopausal symptoms",
          "Various studies yielded conflicting results about use of black cohosh for menopausal symptoms"

          "Clinical trial results are mixed."
        ]
      ],
      "Patient Warnings": [
        "Some literature suggests that the hot-flash relieving effects of black cohosh are due to its estrogenic activity, and therefore, this herb may not be appropriate for certain breast cancer patients. However, lab studies did not show such an effect. Patients should consult a health care professional before taking black cohosh supplements.",
        "Black cohosh should not be confused with blue cohosh."

      "Brand Name": "Remifemin®, Menofem®, Klimadynon®",
      "Scientific Name": "Cimicifuga racemosa",
      "Clinical Summary": "Obtained from root of the plant, black cohosh is used as a dietary supplement to relieve the symptoms of menopause and dysmenorrhea. Black cohosh has antiosteoporotic effects  and enhances bone formation . Clinical studies have shown that black cohosh alone  or in combination with other herbs  is effective in the treatment of menopausal symptoms, but data are conflicting . Conclusions of a meta analysis indicate insufficient evidence to support use of black cohosh for menopausal symptoms \nStudies evaluating black cohosh to treat hot flashes from breast cancer treatment also yielded mixed results . Furthermore, supplementation with black cohosh did not enhance bone density, improve menopausal symptoms, or the 10-year risk of coronary heart disease in early postmenopausal women , but was reported useful for improving sleep A black cohosh extract demonstrated anti-diabetic potential in a study of mice . Human studies have yet to be conducted.\nBlack cohosh has also been investigated for anticancer effects. In vitro studies indicate that it decreases prostate cancer cell proliferation  and induces an apoptotic response in liver cells . However, it also increased the incidence of metastatic disease in mice . Whether it has similar effects in breast cancer patients is not clear, although a retrospective observational study of breast cancer patients found that black cohosh enhanced disease-free survival \nHepatoxicity has been associated with use of black cohosh , although data are conflicting ",

        "Menopausal symptoms",
        "Premenstrual syndrome",
        "Sedation"
      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "Black cohosh relieves menopausal symptoms likely by mimicking neurostransmitters: dopaminergic, noradrenergic, serotoninergic and GABAergic effects have been demonstrated . Black cohosh may have estrogenic effects, but data are conflicting . Studies also show that it has no effect on LH, FSH, prolactin, or estradiol . A black cohosh extract was shown to have antiproliferative and antiestrogenic effects in ER-negative cells. This suggests that black cohosh mediates its effects via an estrogen-independent pathway , possibly through HER-2 signaling \nBlack cohosh also has been investigated for anticancer potential. It repressed the expression of cyclin D1 and ID3, and inhibited proliferation of HepG2, p53 positive, liver cells, in vitro . In prostate cancer cells, a black cohosh extract demonstrated antiproliferative effects, via impaired equilibrative nucleoside transporter (ENT) activity, resulting in hindered nucleoside uptake . It was also reported to induce apoptosis and suppress estradiol-induced cell proliferation in human endometrial adenocarcinoma cells Hepatotoxicity is a major concern with black cohosh use. Evaluation of liver biopsies from two patients who took black cohosh supplements showed the pattern of pathological injury of liver cells to be identical to toxic necrosis, seen during autoimmune hepatitis ",
      "Warnings": [
        "Black cohosh should not be confused with blue cohosh.",

      "Side Effects": [
        "Consumption of a slimming product containing 20 different herbs, bladder wrack being one of them, resulted in hemorrhagic cystitis (inflammation of the urinary bladder) in a 33-year-old woman. Symptoms resolved after discontinuing the product."
      ],
      "Special Point": "Bladder wrack is often referred to as brown kelp but it should not be confused with “kelp,” which is another species of seaweed.",
      "Brand Name": "Maine sea coast vegetables",
      "Scientific Name": "Fucus vesiculosus",
      "Clinical Summary": "Bladder wrack is a seaweed prevalent on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts from Europe to Asia. It is often referred to as brown kelp but it should not be confused with “kelp,” another species of seaweed. Bladder wrack is consumed as food and medicine and is a rich source of iodine. It is used in traditional medicine to treat hypothyroidism due to iodine deficiency and has been proposed as a weight loss supplement. No clinical studies have verified this effect. Bladder wrack is believed to be responsible for the reduced risk of estrogen-related cancers in Asian populations  and may improve menstrual symptoms . Further studies are needed to clarify such effects.\nBladder wrack extract also demonstrated chemopreventive , anti-collagenase and antioxidant properties ; topical application of bladder wrack extract may help improve skin \nHowever, bladder wrack should be used with caution in patients with hormonal-sensitive cancers.",

      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "Bladder wrack extract is rich in iodine and has been used as a natural supplement for thyroid disorder and for obesity. It has been shown to lower plasma cholesterol levels by competitive inhibition via fucosterols. As cholesterol is a precursor for the biosynthesis of steroid hormones, a reduction in cholesterol bioavailability may lower circulating estradiol levels thereby altering menstrual cycling patterns . An extract of bladder wrack reduced 17,beta-estradiol levels and also acted as a competitive inhibitor of estradiol binding to alpha- and beta- estrogen receptors in vitro . In rats, treatment with bladder wrack lengthened overall estrous cycles and reduced circulating 17,beta-estradiol levels \nBladder wrack and related seaweed species have been shown to exhibit anti-hypertensive effects via angiotensin-I-converting enzyme inhibition. The antibacterial and antioxidant properties are thought to be due to its polyphenolic contents . Topical bladder wrack extract reduced skin thickness and improved the mechanical/elastic properties A bladder wrack extract inhibited the cell cyle of proliferating pancreatic cancer cells due to the up-regulation of cell cycle inhibitors, independent of caspases. Also, it showed low cytotoxic activity against non-malignant resting T cells and erythrocytes. Accelerated killing was observed in combination with inhibitors of autophagy ",
      "Warnings": "Consumption of bladder wrack harvested from polluted waters may cause nephrotoxicity due to the presence of heavy metals such as arsenic, cadmium and mercury ",
      "Contraindications": "Bladder wrack acts as an estrogenic receptor modulator and should be used with caution in patients with hormonal-sensitive cancers.",

After a 4-month delay with no improvement, the patient consented to Mohs micrographic surgery. But a few months later, he was diagnosed with colon cancer and elected to self-treat with an oral black salve product and subsequently died.\nA 60-year-old woman developed a large eschar (a piece of dead tissue that falls off the skin, following burns or wounds) on the right neck after using a blemish cream.

      "Mechanism of Action": "Bloodroot was shown to have anticarcinogenic and anti-inflammatory properties in animals . It intercalates with DNA at guanine-cytosine-rich sequences . Sanguinarine inhibits the transcription factor NF kB  and tubulin protein formation . It also activates pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins in immortalized human HaCaT keratinocytes  and induces apoptosis in human prostate carcinoma cells . It was shown to induce apoptosis in HT-29 human colon cancer cells by increasing activation of caspases 3 and 9 \nSanguinarine exhibits antiplatelet effects and reduces platelet thromboxane production. It also suppresses cyclooxygenase-1 . The antiplaque effect of blood root is thought to be caused by the conversion of sanguinarine to an iminium ion that then binds to plaque. When used in oral preparation, bloodroot has been linked with leukoplakia . Bloodroot can inhibit the action of sodium-potassium ATPase and also prolong ventricular refractory period ",

      "How It Works": "Blue-green algae has not been shown to treat or prevent cancer, HIV, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), or other serious medical conditions.\nBlue-green algae are a natural source of protein and vitamins, which may reduce fatigue. Blue-green algae products usually contain either AFA-algae (Aphanizomenon flos aquae) or Spirulina species, or both. Both may have biological activity. In laboratory experiments, calcium spirulan, an extract from Spirulina, stopped doubling of HIV virus, herpes simplex virus, cytomegalovirus, and influenza virus, but it is not known whether any of these effects would occur in the human body. Other studies showed that spirulina protected lab animals from genetic mutations caused by chemicals and radiation, but again, it is unclear whether these effects happen in humans. In healthy humans, AFA-algae appear to increase blood levels of natural killer cells (a type of immune cell). AFA-algae also show anti-viral and anti-mutation activity in the laboratory.\nSpirulina algae also contain high levels of gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), an essential fatty acid that is often able to prevent the accumulation of cholesterol in the body.",

Spirulina species are cultured in alkaline fresh water whereas Aphanizomenon flos aquae (AFA) is naturally grown and harvested from Upper Klamath Lake, Oregon, USA. Blue-green algae products frequently contain one or both of these strains of algae.\nStudies have shown that spirulina may be effective against allergic rhinitis , for managing diabetes , and for lowering cholesterol in patients with nephrotic syndrome-induced hyperlipidemia . Preliminary data indicate that it may also be a safe and effective agent in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus infection \nAnimal studies suggest that spirulina has chemo- and radioprotective effects , but human data are lacking.\nHowever, blue-green algae may be contaminated by strains of algae (e.g. Microcystis species) that are toxic.",

      "Mechanism of Action": "Calcium spirulan, a polysaccharide extract from Spirulina platensis, demonstrates inhibition of HIV-1 viral replication via possible binding and disruption of CD4-gp120 interaction in vitro, although the clinical significance of this is unknown . Calcium spirulan also inhibits replication of herpes simplex I, cytomegalovirus, and influenza.\nOther studies showed that spirulina has chemoprotective and radioprotective effects in animals , affected by stimulation of the hemopoietic system.\nAlthough uncommon, several toxins from Microcystis species of algae may contaminate AFA-algae and Spirulina algal blooms. Anatoxin can cause paralysis of respiratory muscles due to irreversible binding and sustained action of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. Saxitoxin contamination is thought to block nerve cell neuronal transmission due to binding to voltage-gated sodium channels. Microcystins are cyclic heptapeptides that induce hepatotoxicity Spirulina can significantly inhibit cytochrome P450 1A2 and 2E1 enzymes. The same study showed that it also led to significant increase in mRNA/protein levels of CYP2B1 and CYP3A1, but there was no change in the enzyme activities Spirulina was shown to antagonize glioma cell growth in mice by down-regulating angiogenesis, which was mediated in part by regulating the production of interleukin (IL-17) ",

      "Scientific Name": "Borago officinalis",
      "Clinical Summary": "Borage oil, derived from the seeds of the plant, is a rich source of gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) and linoleic acid (LA). In herbal and traditional medicine, borage oil has been used to induce sweating, as an expectorant and anti-inflammatory, to promote lactation, to stimulate adrenal function, and as an alternative source to evening primrose oil for obtaining GLA . It has also been promoted to treat rheumatoid arthritis, atopic dermatitis, diabetic neuropathy, menopause-related symptoms, and gastrointestinal disease In vitro and in vivo studies suggest antimutagenic and cytotoxic effects . In an animal model of senile osteoporosis, a diet rich in borage or fish oils restored inflammation and bone parameters . Borage extract consumption improved markers of disease-induced cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer’s models In humans, studies show that GLA from borage seed oil has some benefits in treating rheumatoid arthritis (RA) . A long-term study evaluating fish and borage seed oils in RA patients at increased risk for cardiovascular disease suggest these may be useful to correct dyslipidemia when used either alone or in combination . Other analyses suggest moderate evidence of GLA-containing oils including borage oil for the relief of RA symptoms such as pain intensity and disability without increased adverse events, but adequate dose and treatment duration are unknown , and there was not enough available evidence to support their current use in RA management Studies are mixed on the effect of borage oil for skin conditions such as atopic eczema  and infantile seborrheic dermatitis . Several analyses indicate that neither evening primrose oil nor borage oil are effective in treating atopic eczema, with improvements being similar to respective placebos . A combination of seed oils from borage and echium (a plant rich in linolenic acid) produced anti-inflammatory effects in patients with mild asthma . In patients with early-stage type 2 diabetes or metabolic syndrome, this combined supplementation also significantly lowered total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels Borage oil contains pyrrolizidine alkaloids that are hepatotoxic . Risk of hepatic damage increases with length of exposure and cumulative dose consumed. Patients should use borage oil certified free of unsaturated pyrrolizidine alkaloids. Borage oil may be unsafe during pregnancy ",

        "Depression",
        "Dermatitis",
        "Menopausal symptoms"
      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "The anti-inflammatory properties of borage oil have been attributed to its high GLA content . It also contains other fatty acids including linoleic, oleic, palmitic, stearic, eicosenoic, and erucic acids . GLA can be converted to the prostaglandin precursor dihomo-gama-linolenic acid (DGLA). DGLA can block the transformation of arachidonic acid to leukotrienes and other prostaglandins . GLA can increase cAMP levels which suppress the synthesis of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, an inflammatory mediator linked to rheumatoid arthritis . The mucilage constituent has an expectorant-like action and malic acid has a mild diuretic effect. The tannin constituent may have mild astringent and constipating actions In vitro, a borage oil formulation demonstrated inhibitory effects on alpha-amylase, an enzyme that hydrolyzes 1,4-alpha-glucoside bonds in oligo- and polysaccharides, which is the first step in digestion of dietary starch and glycogen . In animal models, borage oil improved amyloid-beta-induced long-term potentiation disruption in the hippocampal dentate gyrus, providing a neuroprotective effect attributed to the scavenging of free radicals . Borage-enriched sunflower oil counteracted pro-inflammatory mechanisms and prevented senile osteoporosis, by inhibiting osteoblast-induced osteoclast formation In human studies, dietary supplementation with borage and echium seed oils produced anti-inflammatory effects in mild asthmatics by altering polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) levels and by attenuating leukotriene production Although aerial parts of borage demonstrate affinity for the serotonin transporter, its toxicity profile precludes its further development as an herbal drug . Borage contains several minor constituents known as pyrrolizidine alkaloids which are hepatotoxic, including amabiline, supinine, lycopsamine, intermedine, acetyllycopsamine and acetylintermedine . Borage oil also has teratogenic effects, and its prostaglandin E agonist action may cause premature labor ",
      "Warnings": "Borage contains small amounts of unsaturated pyrrolizidine alkaloids (UPAs) that are hepatotoxic. Consumption of 1–2 g of borage seed oil daily can result in a UPA intake approaching 10 ug. The German Federal Health Agency specified consumption of such products should be limited to no more than 1 ug of UPA daily. Borage oil products should be certified free of UPAs (meeting the criterion of no more than 0.5-1 ug/g)  ",
      "Contraindications": "Liver disease: Patients with liver problems should avoid this product.Pregnancy: Preliminary studies suggest borage oil has teratogenic effects and may cause premature labor ",
      "Adverse Reactions": "Occasional headache, abdominal pain, nausea, belching, and loose stools Possible hepatotoxicity following chronic administration.Case reportStatus epilepticus: In an otherwise previously healthy 41-year-old woman with no family history of epilepsy, associated with borage oil ingested over 1 week ",
      "Herb-Drug Interactions": "Hepatotoxic drugs (eg, anabolic steroids, ketoconazole): Borage contains low concentrations of unsaturated pyrrolizidine alkaloids also known to cause hepatotoxic effects Anticoagulants (eg, warfarin): May increase bleeding risk or potentiate effects of warfarin therapy Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): Theoretically, concomitant use would decrease the effects of borage oil, as NSAIDs interfere with prostaglandin E synthesis ",

      "How It Works": "Boswellia has been shown effective for inflammatory conditions, such as arthritis. Its anticancer effects have not been demonstrated in humans.\nBoswellia, a tree gum resin often used in Ayurvedic medicine, was analyzed in the laboratory and found to contain boswellic acid, which scientists think accounts for its biological activity. In lab animals, boswellic acid inhibited an enzyme that is important in the process of inflammation, and it therefore reduces swelling caused by chemicals or arthritis. It also slowed down the replication of cancer cells and caused cell death of some cancer cells in the laboratory. Unlike other anti-inflammatory drugs , boswellic acid does not appear to reduce pain or fever, in lab animals.\nBoswellia’s anti-inflammatory effects were supported in a few clinical trials of patients with colitis and osteoarthritis. Boswellia was also studied in the maintenance of Crohn’s disease remission, but showed no significant benefit.\nEven though similar in many functions, boswellia should not be confused with guggul or myrrh",

      ],
      "Scientific Name": "Boswellia serrata",
      "Clinical Summary": "Boswellia serrata is a tree prevalent in India, the Middle East and North Africa. The gummy exudate or the resin obtained by peeling away the bark is commonly known as frankincense or olibanum. Also known as Indian frankincense, Bowellia is used widely in Ayurveda to treat arthritis, ulcerative colitis, coughs, sores, snakebites, and asthma. The major component is boswellic acid , which was shown in animal studies to be a potent 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor with anti-inflammatory and antiarthritic effects . It also demonstrated cytotoxic properties , and prevented intestinal tumorigenesis in a murine model . Essential oil of boswellia also has antimicrobial activities . Data from clinical trials indicate effectiveness of boswellia for bronchial asthma , ulcerative colitis  and osteo-muscular pain .  However, evidence is mixed for its benefits for osteoarthritis  and collagenous colitis . Boswellia was also investigated for its role in maintenance of Crohn’s disease remission, but it demonstrated no significant benefit \nPreliminary findings suggest boswellia’s effectiveness in reducing cerebral edema in patients with brain tumors following radiotherapy . Also, a boswellia-based cream was found to be effective in preventing skin damage due to radiotherapy in breast cancer patients . Other data suggest that a combination of boswellic acid, betaine, and myo-inositol treatment may help to reduce mammary density, a risk factor for breast cancer Although similar in many functions, boswellia should not be confused with guggul or myrrh",

        "Colitis",
        "Inflammation",
        "Menstrual cramps"
      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "Boswellic acid, the major constituent of boswellia, is thought to contribute to most of the herb’s pharmacological activities. In vitro and animal studies show that boswellic acid has anti-inflammatory by inhibiting 5-lipoxygenase  and cyclooxygenase-1 . It also inhibits the signaling pathways of the transcription factor, nuclear factor (NF-KappaB), in macrophages in mouse model of psoriasis, markedly decreasing the production of the pro-inflammatory key cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) . Unlike other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, however, boswellic acid failed to show analgesic or antipyretic effects \nResearch on the cytotoxic effects of boswellic acid indicates that it induces p21 expression through a p53-independent pathway and causes apoptosis in glioma  and leukemia  cell lines. In addition, a Boswellia extract induced apoptosis in a cervical cancer cell line by inducing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress ; other apoptotic mechanisms exhibited by Boswellia are via early generation of nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species that up regulate time-dependent expression of p53/p21/PUMA , and by inhibiting microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 (mPGES-1) and decreasing the prostaglandin (PGE2) level and its downstream targets \nA semisynthetic analog of boswellic acid, 3-alpha-Butyryloxy-beta-boswellic acid, demonstrated significant growth inhibition in Ehrlich Ascitic Tumour (EAT), Ehrlich Ascitic Carcinoma (EAC) and Sarcoma- 180 tumour models, via down-regulation of NF-KappaB and by induction of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage . In other studies, acetyl-boswellic acids were shown to inhibit topoisomerases by competing with DNA for binding sites . Whereas acetyl-11-keto-beta-boswellic acid (AKBA) inhibited the activation of signal transducers and activators of transcription-3 (STAT-3), which has been linked to survival, proliferation, chemoresistance, and angiogenesis of tumor cells . Conversely, AKBA was found to inhibit human prostate tumor growth via inhibition of angiogenesis induced by VEGFR2 signaling pathways . Further research is needed to resolve this discrepancy and to clarify the role of AKBA.In vitro studies show gum resin extracts of Boswellia have antiplatelet effect by inhibiting clotting factors Xa and XIa. ",

      "How It Works": "There is no clinical evidence to support the use of bovine cartilage for the treatment of cancer or HIV.\nThe use of cartilage products for treating cancer partially stems from the theory that since cartilage does not contain blood vessels, it must contain substances that would prevent the growth of blood vessels around tumors, a process known as angiogenesis. There is some laboratory support for the anti-angiogenic properties of shark cartilage, but almost none for bovine cartilage. Catrix®, a bovine cartilage product, was used in a laboratory experiment against isolated samples of several cancer cell lines, with positive results at high doses. However, there is still little evidence that these anti-cancer effects can occur in the human body.\nBecause bovine cartilage supplements may contain the same specialized proteins that make up human cartilage, they might assist with the resynthesis of cartilage in people with osteoarthritis. It has also been suggested that bovine cartilage can enhance immune response as well, but this effect has not been shown in humans.",

Preliminary data also suggest that oral administration of bovine colostrum may reduce postoperative endotoxemia during abdominal surgery  and postoperative C-reactive protein (CRP)-plasma levels in patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery . There is some evidence that bovine colostrum can prevent gastrointestinal damage caused by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)  and is effective in treating distal colitis \nBovine colostrum may contain high levels of naturally occurring estrogen .

      "Mechanism of Action": "Although the high concentration of immunoglobulins may account for bovine colostrum’s effects, the exact mechanism is not known. Studies suggest that bovine colostrum improves exercise performance  by increasing serum insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and may enhance immune response in humans . Others have shown that colostrum derived from cows immunized with C. parvum was effective in the treatment of diarrhea induced by C. parvum in AIDS patients . Similarly, colostrum from cows immunized with rotavirus alleviated symptoms of rotaviral diarrhea in children . Colostrum also reduced diarrhea associated with E.coli. Preliminary data from some studies indicate that oral administration of bovine colostrum may reduce postoperative endotoxemia during abdominal surgery  and postoperative CRP-plasma levels in patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery .

Sulforaphane also suppresses cancer development through various molecular targets. It induces G2/M cell cycle arrest via cyclin-dependent kinases and triggers dose-dependent apoptosis. Sulforaphane also inhibits histone deacetylase by its metabolites in vitro In a small study, broccoli sprout homogenates enhanced antiviral defense responses via peripheral blood NK cell activation and increased granzyme B production ",

      "Clinical Summary": "An enzyme obtained from the stem of pineapple, bromelain belongs to a group of plant-derived proteolytic enzymes that also includes papain, and has a wide range of applications. In vitro and some in vivo studies demonstrate its anti-inflammatory  properties. Bromelain reduces serum fibrinogen levels, supports fibrinolysis and has been investigated for its debriding effects on burn wounds . In addition, it may be useful for treating some skin conditions . Bromelain reduces mild, acute knee pain in a dose-dependent fashion . It was also shown to reduce post-operative pain and swelling, and improve quality of life . Studies of bromelain’s pain relieving effect on patients with arthritis yielded mix results \nStudies done in vitro and in mice have shown that bromelain has chemopreventive  and antitumorigenic effects . Bromelain and other proteolytic enzymes were used as adjuvants in cancer treatments . It also increased the survival indices of animals bearing leukemia, sarcoma, lung, breast, and ascetic tumors ; however, the anticancer effects of bromelain have not been evaluated in clinical trials.\nTheoretically, bromelain may interfere with anticoagulation therapy and increase bleeding risk due to its antithrombotic effects. Bromelain also inhibits cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9 activity ",

      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "Proteolytic removal of cell surface molecules by bromelain may account for some of its activities. Studies show that bromelain prevents platelet aggregation and adhesion of platelets to blood vessel endothelial cells as well as improves ischemia-reperfusion injury . It can act as an anti-inflammatory agent by reducing levels of prostaglandin E2 and thromboxane A2 . In addition, bromelain inhibits neutrophil migration in response to IL-8 during inflammation  and decreases pro-inflammatory chemokine and cytokine secretion . Topical application of bromelain may be used for the skin debridement of burns \nOral enzymes such as bromelain have been proposed as additive agents for cancer therapy . Proposed mechanisms include down-regulation of the immunosuppressive cytokine, TGF-beta , direct inhibition of tumor cell growth, modulation of immune cell function, modulation of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), and the effects on platelet aggregation and thrombosis mentioned above . Studies does in mice showed that bromelain induced apoptosis-related proteins along with inhibition of NF-kappaB-driven Cox-2 expression by blocking the MAPK and Akt/protein kinase B signaling in DMBA-TPA-induced skin tumors . Bromelain also induces the expression of autophagy-related proteins, light chain 3 protein B II (LC3BII), and beclin-1 thereby facilitating apoptosis in mammary carcinoma cells ",

      "How It Works": "TheBudwig Diet has not been proven to treat or prevent cancer.\nThe Budwig Diet is an unproven anticancer treatment developed by the German biochemist Dr. Johanna Budwig in the 1950s. The diet consists of multiple daily servings of flaxseed oil and cottage cheese, as well as vegetables, fruits and juices. Processed foods, meats, most dairy products and sugar are prohibited. Budwig believed that the combination of cottage cheese and flaxseed oil, a food high in polyunsaturated fatty acids, would improve cellular functioning. No large-scale clinical studies have been conducted using the Budwig diet.\nWhile a diet consisting of large amounts of vegetables and fruits can be beneficial, diets restricted in meat and dairy products may reduce the intake of essential nutrients leading to nutritional deficiencies. Some variations of the diet encourage daily sunbathing to energize the fatty acids, and a coffee or oil enema. However, coffee enemas can result in electrolyte imbalance, infections, inflammation of the rectum and colon, and burns. High levels of sun exposure can result in an increased risk of sunburn and skin cancer.",

      "Special Point": "Eating a well-balanced diet rich in vegetables and fruit can be beneficial for health. A restricted diet can lead to nutritional deficiencies. There is no scientific evidence that supports the Budwig Diet in disease prevention. More importantly, delaying or avoiding standard medical treatment can have serious consequences.",
      "Clinical Summary": "Developed by Dr. Johanna Budwig in the 1950s, the Budwig diet is an unproven cancer treatment featuring multiple daily servings of flaxseed oil and cottage cheese. It is often combined with procedures such as coffee enemas in alternative cancer treatment regimens. Budwig believed that cancer was caused by the lack of polyunsaturated fatty acids, and that a combination of flax oil and cottage cheese would improve cellular function.\nThe diet consists of a mixture of flax oil and cottage cheese as well as vegetables, fruits, and juices. It prohibits consumption of sugar, animal fats, shellfish, processed foods, soy and most dairy products, and encourages daily sunbathing \nAlthough Budwig wrote books and papers to provide anecdotal evidence and biochemical mechanisms of the diet, no clinical trials have been published in any peer-reviewed medical journal. Polyunsaturated fatty acids, like omega-3 found in flaxseeds, have been shown to exert anticancer activities , but there is no evidence that such a diet has any benefit in preventing or treating cancer in humans. Whereas a balanced diet consisting of vegetables and fruits can be beneficial for general health, restricted diets may increase risk of nutritional deficiencies . High levels of sun exposure can result in increased risk of sunburn and skin cancer The Budwig diet is not recommended by most mainstream cancer treatment centers.",

      "Mechanism of Action": "Dr. Budwig developed her diet based on the hypothesis that cancer is caused by reduced uptake of oxygen by cell membranes in the absence of omega-3 fatty acids (O3FAs) such as linolenic acid . While metabolic changes such as increased aerobic glycolysis and fatty acid synthesis occur in cancerous cells,  the role of O3FAs in the pathogenesis and treatment of cancer is still under investigation . The polyunsaturated O3FAs in flaxseed oil have been shown to decrease levels of proinflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha and Interleukin-1 beta . O3FAs also demonstrated antineoplastic properties by increasing intracellular reactive oxygen species and decreasing protumorigenic prostaglandins . Flax oil supplements increased total phospholipid fatty acid content in erythrocytes  , but the implication of this finding in cancer treatment is unknown. Flaxseed supplements also inhibit proliferation of human prostate cancer  and inhibit breast cancer growth in vitro by downregulating growth factors and increasing p53 expression . Furthermore, whole flaxseed contains lignans, phytoestrogens which may also have antineoplastic properties and exert hormonal effects \nBudwig believed that combining cottage cheese and flaxseed oil allowed for better availability of essential fatty acids through the plasma membrane, allowing for improved aerobic cellular respiration . The effect of cottage cheese consumption on the bioavailability of O3FAs has not been studied. Processed fats, saturated fats, animal fats, processed foods, and sugar are prohibited in the Budwig diet because they are thought to interfere with oxygen uptake and cellular respiration. Epidemiological studies show that people who consume lacto-vegetarian diets have lower incidence of gastrointestinal cancer compared with non-vegetarians , although these studies indicate association rather than causation.\nAn animal study showed that greater tumor regression occurred in mice treated with trastuzumab therapy plus flax oil compared with those treated with trastuzumab alone ",

      "Scientific Name": "Bupleurum chinense, Bupleurum scorzoneraefolium, Bupleurum falcatum, Radix Bupleuri",
      "Clinical Summary": "Bupleurum is an important herb used in traditional Chinese and Japanese medicine. It is frequently prescribed in combination with other herbs to treat cold, fever, malaria, gastrointestinal disorders and chronic liver diseases.\nIn vitro studies show that Bupleurum has antiviral , hepatoprotective , anti-inflammatory , antiproliferative , and chemopreventive  properties. Bupleurum also demonstrated inhibitory effects against allergic asthma in animal studies Saikosaponins, the major components, were found to enhance the cytotoxicity of cisplatin against solid tumors . Herbal formulas such as Xiao Chai Hu Tang (Sho-saiko-to), which contain bupleurum as major ingredient, were found effective in treating hepatitis and liver cancers.However, poor quality control is a major concern with commercial herbal products. A sample of Bupleurum was found contaminated with a nephrotoxic drug, aristolactone ",
      "Purported Uses2": [
        "Cancer treatment",
        "Cirrhosis",
        "Common cold",
        "Fever",

        "Infections",
        "Inflammation",
        "Liver disease",
        "Malaria"
      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "The saikosaponins in bupleurum are mainly responsible for the plant’s medicinal activities. In vitro studies indicate that saikosaponins exert anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting arachidonic acid metabolism . The anti-inflammatory activity of bupleurum polysaccharides is attributed to their inhibitory effect on LPS-mediated Toll like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling \nSaikosaponin-d promotes interleukin-2 production and receptor expression as well as modulating T-lymphocyte function . The anti-epileptic effects of saikosaponin a were shown to be via enhancing the transient inactivating potassium current in rat hippocampal CA1 neurons \nIn an animal model, bupleurum showed weak antihistamine activity  \nThe herb’s apoptotic effects are thought to be partly mediated by increases in c-myc and p53 mRNA levels accompanied by a decrease in bcl-2 mRNA level  and by inhibition of telomerase activity . In addition, bupleurum demonstrated anti-adhesive and hemolytic effects in some solid tumor cells ",
      "Warnings": "Bupleurum is the major ingredient in an herbal formula, Sho-saiko-to, which has been associated with interstitial pneumonitis.",

      "Clinical Summary": "Burdock, a perennial plant native to Europe and Northern Asia, is now found worldwide. The root has been consumed as food in Asia for many centuries. The fruit is valued in traditional Chinese medicine as a blood purifier, a cure for sore throat and colds, and as a topical remedy for skin disorders including acne, eczema and psoriasis. It is also used to treat anorexia, gout, cancer and HIV, although no published clinical studies have evaluated these claims.Preclinical data indicate that burdock has anti-inflammatory , antibacterial , antiulcerogenic , hepatoprotective , antidiabetic  and anticancer  effects. A clinical study found that topical application of a formulation containing burdock extract significantly improved dermal extracellular matrix metabolism and visibly reduced wrinkles . A mixture of burdock fruit and astragalus root reduced urinary protein and albumin, and improved lipid metabolism and post-prandial blood glucose in patients with diabetic nephropathy \nA preparation of burdock tea was found contaminated with atropine, an alkaloid . Patients should be aware that poor quality control is a major concern with commercial herbal products.",

      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "Arctiin and arctigenin, the lignans present in burdock, exert anti-inflammatory effects by inhibit the pro-inflammatory factors, nitric oxide (NO), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) . The polyacetylenes and chlorogenic acid have antibacterial properties and are thought responsible for burdock’s beneficial effects against infections and skin disorders Arctigenin and arctiin, along with lignans matairesinol, (iso)lappaol A, lappaol C, and lappaol F were shown to up-regulate the expression of Jun-N-terminal kinase-1 (jnk-1), and promote longetivty and stress resistance in the round worm Caenorhabditis elegans via the JNK-1-DAF-16 cascade Animal studies indicate that burdock extract induces hypoglycemia and increases carbohydrate tolerance, stimulates uterine smooth muscle, and has antimutagenic activity. The tannin extract induces macrophage response . Burdock also exhibits hepatoprotective effects in rats due to its antioxidative activity Further, Lappaol F was shown to induce G(1) and G(2) cell-cycle arrest, induce cell death in several cancer cell lines, and to activate caspases . In other studies, arctigenin inhibited the proliferation, and induced caspase-3-dependent apoptosis of ovarian cancer cells via suppression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)/nitric oxide (NO)/signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3)/survivin signalling pathway ",

      "How It Works": "No studies have been performed to determine the safety or efficacy of Controlled Amino Acid Therapy (CAAT) for the treatment of cancer.\nThe proponents of CAAT maintain that eating a specially formulated diet that is low in carbohydrates and deprived of certain amino acids essential for cell replication may be effective as an adjuvant cancer therapy. The manufacturer cites studies showing that low calorie diets are effective in promoting tumor shrinkage in animals. Other studies demonstrating that certain cancer cell lines may be adversely affected by glucose or amino acid deprivation have been mentioned. There are no clinical studies to show this therapy is an effective cancer treatment in humans.",

      "Clinical Summary": "Controlled Amino Acid Therapy (CAAT) was developed by Angelo John of the A. P. John Institute for Cancer Research. It is a protocol that involves amino acid and carbohydrate deprivation. The objective of this therapy is to impair the development of cancer cells by altering cell formation through structure, energy, blood vessels, growth hormones and function. The regimen consists of a diet that restricts intake of carbohydrates and proteins, and involves use of supplements. In addition, supplementation with Superoxide Dismutasecurcumin, parsley, quercetinlycopeneVitamin D and green tea extract is encouraged. (See individual monographs for more information about those supplements.) The protocol is meant to be maintained for six to nine months as an adjunct to conventional chemotherapy and radiation. Whereas the Institute’s now defunct website described studies that support the theories behind the protocol, no studies have been conducted to determine the safety or efficacy of the regimen itself.",

      "Mechanism of Action": "According to its proponents, CAAT curbs the growth of cancer cells by impairing a number of factors essential to their growth. Restricting a cancer cell’s access to glycine is thought to limit its ability to replicate its DNA, build new blood vessels, and create growth factors and other hormones essential for metastatic growth. Additionally, the low-carbohydrate diet is thought to inhibit glycolysis, the main mechanism for cancer cells to derive energ"

      "How It Works": "Adequate calcium intake may help prevent osteoporosis, bone fracture, and colorectal cancer. However, higher calcium intake may increase the risk of cardiovascular events and prostate cancerCalcium plays several essential roles in the human body. It is a main structural element in bone, which acts as a reservoir for calcium so that stable blood calcium levels are maintained. This is necessary for the many roles calcium plays in cells including muscle contraction, nerve transmission, blood clotting, and enzyme reactions. When calcium intake and bodily estrogen levels are low, the body takes calcium from bones and uses it for other processes, resulting in osteoporosis.Inadequate blood calcium levels are linked to high blood pressure. Whether the use of calcium supplements can increase the risk for heart disease or cardiac events is still unclear. The links of calcium supplements to increased prostate cancer risk may occur for reasons other than the supplements themselves.Because the risks and benefits of calcium supplements are still unclear and calcium can interact with the absorption of a number of drugs, patients should check with their healthcare provider about whether supplementation is warranted.",

      "Clinical Summary": "Calcium is an essential mineral responsible for many physiological functions in the body. It is stored in the bones and helps maintain bone structure. Calcium also plays an important role in cell signaling and muscle contraction. Dietary calcium can be found in dairy products, dark greens, legumes, nuts and fish. Natural supplements are derived from minerals, oyster shells and occasionally corals. Calcium can be found in some antacids as well.The effects of calcium have been studied across a range of conditions including cardiovascular disease , osteoporosis , bone density loss , fracture prevention , premenstrual syndrome , preeclampsia , lead poisoning , and various cancers Long-term calcium supplement use is associated with an increased risk of coronary artery calcification . Some studies suggest that calcium supplementation could lead to cardiovascular disease or events , but other researchers have not agreed with these conclusions . Calcium and vitamin D supplementation may benefit postmenopausal women who do not have pre-existing risk factors such as coronary heart disease, diabetes, or hypertension  and large long-term studies in women  did not find adverse cardiovascular associations with calcium supplementation. However, high intakes of calcium supplements did increase cardiovascular mortality in men . Another study shows calcium supplement intake is associated with dementia in women after stroke There is also conflicting evidence regarding the benefits of calcium on bone density and fractures . In postmenopausal women, neither dietary calcium  nor calcium plus vitamin D supplementation  reduced hip fracture risk, although the latter study found significant reductions at 7 years . Subgroup analysis further suggested that supplementation along with estrogen therapy conferred additive protection against hip fractures . However, there are no prevention benefits with calcium and vitamin D supplementation for bone mineral density loss in breast cancer patients  or for older adults to help prevent fractures . Interestingly, calcium plus vitamin D3 supplementation was shown to mitigate the loss of bone density associated with antiretroviral therapy . In men, bone mineral density and bone loss rates were not related to dietary calcium intake Intake of both dietary and supplemental calcium is linked with lower risk of colorectal cancer , but had no effect on colorectal adenomas . Other studies have shown calcium intake to be associated with a higher risk for prostate cancer . Links between prostate cancer risk and a genetic disposition for high intestinal absorption of calcium among African-American men have also been noted . Long-term studies suggest the association of calcium with risks for total, lethal, and high-grade prostate cancers  are less strong when phosphorus intake is also considered . For women, studies suggest benefits with calcium and vitamin D for reducing risk for hematologic malignancy , all-cancer risk , and mortality . However, the Women’s Health Initiative Studies found no association between calcium and vitamin D supplementation and reduced risk of colorectal cancer, invasive cancers, or mortality A proper diet to achieve a balance among nutrients including sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium and vitamin D is important to affect risks for hypertension as well as cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events . The risk–benefit ratio of supplementation is likely to vary, depending on dietary calcium intake, sex, age, ethnicity, and individual risks for cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis . Current evidence is insufficient to assess the benefits of combined calcium and vitamin D supplementation for fracture prevention  or in cancer populations including those receiving androgen deprivation therapy, aromatase inhibitors, or undergoing chemotherapy-induced menopause . Patients should consult with their oncologist or oncology healthcare team, especially since calcium supplements can interact with a number of drugs. Intake of high dose (>1g/day) calcium supplements can also increase the risk of ischemic stroke ",

Calcium reserves are found mostly in the bones, helping to maintain skeletal structure.The association of supplemental but not dietary calcium with increased cardiovascular risk could be related to their differing, acute effects on serum calcium . Calcium supplementation may fail to compensate for renal calcium loss, resulting in increased circulatory calcium that could lead to coronary artery deposits . Reduced dietary calcium may cause calcium depletion in membrane storage sites resulting in less stability of vascular smooth muscle cell membranes, as optimal concentrations stabilize these membranes, inhibit calcium entry into cells, and reduce vasoconstriction . Other researchers suggest that gastrointestinal events associated with calcium supplements may account for an increase in self-reported cardiovascular events Observed associations of dairy with overall prostate cancer risk may be related to the modulation of vitamin D metabolism by calcium and phosphorus . Saturated fat in whole dairy correlating with higher C-peptide concentrations, along with obesity and hyperinsulinemia are proposed for associations of whole milk with fatal prostate cancer . Other suggested mechanisms include increasing levels of ionized calcium in the blood, as prostate cancer cells express both calcium-sensing receptors and calcium-dependent voltage-gated channels, the stimulation of which by extracellular calcium increases prostate cancer cell growth . In African American men, positive associations between calcium and aggressive prostate cancer have been linked to single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the CDX-2 binding site of the VDR gene ",

    "details": {
      "How It Works": "Although lab studies suggest anticancer effects, calcium glucarate has not been shown to treat or prevent cancer in humans.\nCalcium glucarate is absorbed in the intestine and converted into a molecule that inhibits beta-glucuronidase, thereby increasing the elimination of cancer-causing substances from the body. For example, rats that were exposed to carcinogens and fed calcium glucarate during the initiation and progression of their tumors had a slower onset of tumor development and a smaller number of tumors than rats that were not fed calcium glucarate. Calcium glucarate also increases the rate of estrogen elimination, which may reduce estrogen levels in the body. This explains its popular use as supportive care among estrogen-sensitive breast cancer patients. However, positive results in animal studies do not always mean that a drug will work in humans. No clinical trials have tested whether calcium glucarate has these effects in humans.",
      "Purported Uses": [
        [
          "To detoxify the body",
          "Laboratory and animal studies suggest that calcium glucarate speeds up the elimination of carcinogens from the body. Human studies have not been conducted."
        ],
        [
          "To prevent and treat cancer",
          "A handful of animal studies show that calcium glucarate can slow the development and reduce the number of tumors in rats exposed to carcinogens, but human data are lacking. Only one small study in humans suggests that calcium glucarate supplementation might reduce cancer risk for some individuals. More well-designed studies are needed to confirm such effects."
        ]
      ],
      "Scientific Name": "D-Glucaric acid salt",
      "Clinical Summary": "Calcium glucarate is the salt and the commercial form of glucaric acid, which occurs naturally in a variety of foods including apples, oranges, broccoli, and spinach . Calcium glucarate and other derivatives have been used to prevent and treat cancer. Patients with breast cancer often self-medicate with calcium glucarate supplements following surgery or adjunctive treatments. The glucarate component, not the calcium, is thought to account for its activity. Following administration, glucarate is converted to D-glucaro-1,4-lactone, which inhibits beta-glucuronidase In vitro and animal studies suggest that inhibition of beta-glucuronidase may prevent carcinogenesis , as well as initiation and promotion of cancer cells . Increased elimination of carcinogens and hormones, including estrogen, has also been shown . In colon  and lung  cancer models, calcium glucarate administration exerted chemopreventive effects in the post-initiation phase of carcinogenesis. Dietary calcium glucarate also inhibited oral carcinogenesis . Topical calcium glucarate suppressed tumor development in murine skin tumors , and enhanced chemopreventive effects were achieved with a topical butyric acid, nicotinamide, and calcium glucarate combination . A combination of topical ursolic acid and dietary calcium glucarate supplementation reduced skin tumor promotion and inflammatory signaling Preliminary findings from a human study suggest that low glucaric acid levels and/or high beta-glucuronidase levels are markers of detoxification system impairment, and that calcium glucarate supplementation might reduce the cancer risk of some individuals . Subsequent studies have not materialized and are needed to confirm such effects.",
      "Food Sources": "Cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli, cabbage, and Brussels sprouts; oranges, grapefruit, apples, spinach, carrots, potatoes, lettuce, bean sprouts, grapes ",
      "Purported Uses2": [
        "Cancer prevention",
        "Cancer treatment",
        "Detoxification"
      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "The glucarate component, not the calcium, accounts for the activity of calcium glucarate, which is absorbed from the gut as D-glucaric acid. This is further converted to D-glucaro-1,4-lactone, which is thought to inhibit beta-glucuronidase activity . Beta-glucuronidase has been shown to decrease the rate of elimination of estrogen and carcinogens such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and nitrosamines by deconjugation . Inhibition of beta-glucuronidase activity with calcium glucarate improves excretion of metabolized estrogen and carcinogens . D-glucarate can also be metabolized by gut bacteria, inhibit bacterial beta-glucuronidase, and potentially alter the enterohepatic cycle.In animal studies, calcium glucarate reduced the quantity of benzo[a]pyrene-induced lung lesions with mutated K-rasand p53 genes in the post-initiation phase via DNA adduct removal, mutagenic suppression, and anti-inflammatory activity . Antitumorigenic effects of topical calcium glucarate may be due to stimulated differentiation via induction of transglutaminase activity and suppression of proliferation , as well as inhibition of thymidine kinase and aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase activities, thus preventing carcinogen-DNA binding . Enhanced chemopreventive effects by a topical butyric acid, nicotinamide, and calcium glucarate combination used on murine skin tumors occurred via induced mitochondria-mediated apoptosis, upregulated p21, and downregulated Bcl-2, mut p53 . In another study this combination regulated miR-203 status through epigenetic or biogenetic modulations before and after tumor development to a greater degree than each of the individual compounds . Reduced epidermal hyperplasia with a combination of topical ursolic acid and dietary calcium glucarate supplementation caused a marked decrease in COX-2 and IL-6 expression In a preliminary human study, calcium glucarate supplementation suppressed beta-glucuronidase levels while increasing serum glucaric acid levels ",

      "Mechanism of Action": "The triterpenoids present in calendula have anti-inflammatory  and anti-HIV  effects, and a calendula extract suppressed cell fusion, which may inhibit early events in the HIV replication cycle . Calendula also exhibits hepato- and reno-protective effects which are likely due to its antioxidant activity . The photoprotective effect of topical gel formulations containing calendula is thought to be associated with an improvement in collagen synthesis in the sub-epidermal connective tissue . In addition, calendula affords cardioprotection that involves modulating the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory pathways by activation of Akt (a serine/threonine protein kinase) and Bcl2 (a protein that regulates apoptosis), and down regulation of tumor necrosis factor (TNF alpha) . In another study, calendula was shown to inhibit human gingival fibroblast-mediated degradation of collagen and matrix metalloprotease (MMP-2) activity \nThe essential oil from calendula flowers was shown to have sun protection activity . And application of a cream containing essential oil of calendula prevented UV-B-induced alterations in the skin in a murine model . Calendula extract also accelerated healing of experimentally-induced thermal burns by increasing collagen-hydroxyproline and hexosamine, which are two bio-indicators of wound healing ",

This mixture of chemicals, the manufacturers claim, normalizes cellular metabolism and balances the vibrational frequency of cancer cells, causing them to die or return to a healthy state.

The catechol component is claimed to inhibit cellular respiration in cancer cells so that they might fall from the “critical point” to a primitive state and self-destruct. In addition, CanCell is thought to balance the vibrational frequency of cancer cells, returning them to a normal state.The manufacturers of Cantron claim that imbalance in cellular respiration results in cellular damage. Cantron is believed to help maintain balance through the electrolyte and antioxidant properties of its hydroxyquinone and catechol components. Neither set of claims is supported by scientific data.",

      "Clinical Summary": "Capsaicin is the active component derived from the fruit of capsicum or cayenne pepper. It has been used in traditional medical systems as a remedy to relieve muscle and arthritic pain and to treat cluster headaches and psoriasis. For these purposes, capsaicin is an active ingredient in some topical creams and nasal sprays. It is also available in a prescription-strength patch. Oral formulations are marketed largely for digestive and circulatory problems, poor appetite, and weight loss. (See Cayenne Pepper)Studies support benefits of topical low-concentration capsaicin formulations for psoriasis , prurigo nodularis , and pruritus ani . Although topical capsaicin has been included among conditional recommendations for osteoarthritis , its utility for rheumatoid arthritis remains inconclusive . An older clinical trial shows capsaicin 0.075% cream may control post-surgical pain in cancer patients . A case report in a palliative care patient using capsaicin 0.025% for opioid-refractory upper extremity pain also reported benefit A high-concentration dermal capsaicin patch was shown safe and effective for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia , and was approved for prescription use. Data also show its effectiveness in controlling diabetic peripheral neuropathy ; in affecting sustained relief from neuropathic pain due to different etiologies including post-operative and post-traumatic ; and from neuropathic pain arising from radiculopathies . However, a subsequent application for HIV-associated neuropathic pain was rejected . A recent systematic review cites some benefit for both postherpetic neuralgia and HIV-neuropathy over controls. However, the patch is best used when other therapies have failed due to the small number of patients who may benefit (1 in 8) and unknown risks . Low-concentration capsaicin was determined as unlikely to have any meaningful use for these conditions in clinical practice . Data are also limited in patients with post-mastectomy neuropathy In addition, topical capsaicin has been reported in a case series to be effective in resolving hyperemesis associated with use of cannabis . Only a few small studies suggest intranasal capsaicin of divergent formulations may be helpful for rhinitis , and its effectiveness for cluster headaches is unknown There is continued controversy over whether capsaicin acts as a carcinogen, co-carcinogen, or anti-carcinogen . For example, capsaicin has demonstrated chemopreventive and antiproliferative effects against various cell lines including breast , bladder , prostate cancer cells . Also, findings from a small study suggest utility of high-concentration dermal capsaicin patch in relieving pain associated with chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy . However, long-term topical application was shown to increase skin carcinogenesis in mice treated with a tumor promoter , although such effects may be concentration-dependent . Therefore, more studies are needed to clarify the roles of capsaicin in relationship to cancer.",

      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "The analgesic effect of capsaicin is multifactorial. It depolarizes C-fiber polymodal nociceptors . This causes the release of substance P, the neurotransmitter that relays pain signals to the brain , which causes an initial increase in pain. With repeated application, pain subsides due to the eventual depletion of substance P at the afferent neurons . Capsaicin also activates transient receptor potential vanilloid subfamily member 1 (TRPV1, also known as the capsaicin receptor) , causing selective and reversible defunctionalization of cutaneous sensory nerve endings expressing TRPV1 Studies on various cancer cell lines have shown that capsaicin demonstrates chemopreventive properties by causing cell-cycle arrest and inducing apoptosis, or by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) and depolarizing mitochondrial membranes, and through caspase activation . Alternatively, the co-carcinogenic effect of capsaicin on chemically-induced skin carcinogenesis is mediated through the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), but not TRPV1 . Further exploration of caspaicin-induced apoptosis, in glioma cells, found inhibition of autophagy to be a likely contributor . Interestingly, capsaicin was also shown to induce autophagy by enhancing the levels of autophagy markers LC3-II and Atg5, increasing p62 and Fap-1 degradation and increasing caspase-3 activity to induce apoptosis in human nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells ",
      "Warnings": "Capsaicin can irritate mucous membranes, the eyes, and broken skin. For all capsaicin creams, gels, and lotions, wear gloves during application and wash hands with soap and water afterwards to avoid spreading the active ingredient to these sensitive areas. Capsaicin use should be considered when encountering adverse cardiovascular effects in the absence of illicit substance use and especially in young patients ",

Inflammation was controlled within 1 week using topical corticosteroids, and there were no further recurrences over long-term follow-up Burns at the application site: Cases of serious burns have occurred following use of over-the-counter capsaicin products. In some cases, hospitalization was required. Discontinue use and seek immediate medical attention if pain, swelling, or blistering occur following application ",

      "How It Works": "Some clinical trials show that carnitine supplementation is helpful for patients with angina, heart disease, or peripheral vascular disease.Carnitine is a nutrient found naturally in the body and in foods such as meat and dairy products, beans, and avocados. It plays an important role in energy production by delivering fatty acids that are processed within the cells to be used as fuel. It also helps to prevent damaging effects that can occur when fatty acids build up outside of cells.L-carnitine is more readily absorbed in the body if obtained from food rather than supplements. However some people, such as those with a genetic deficiency who are fatigued because energy production is greatly reduced, respond well with carnitine supplements. In addition, studies in some patients with heart conditions show improved heart function and ability to exercise after taking carnitine.There is less evidence for the use of carnitine supplements for other conditions. In clinical trials, cancer patients who have higher blood levels of carnitine generally have higher functioning and more energy. Other studies are looking at whether carnitine can have a protective effect against the damaging effects of cisplatin on the kidney and small intestines and whether it can suppress thyroid hormone. However, one particular form, acetyl-L-carnitine, is known to increase chemotherapy side effects, so it is important to discuss any use of this supplement with your oncologist.",
      "Purported Uses": [
        [
          "To manage heart disease",
          "Several clinical trials suggest that carnitine can enhance physical performance, increase exercise tolerance in patients with stable angina, reduce heart damage after a heart attack, and possibly increase survival in patients with heart disease. It may improve circulation in peripheral vascular disease. However, results from one large trial of patients who had a heart attack found no reductions in heart failure events or death with carnitine therapy."

      "Scientific Name": "Beta-hydroxy-gamma-trimethyl-amino-butyric acid",
      "Clinical Summary": "Carnitine is a nutrient that plays an important role in fatty acid absorption and mitochondria function. It can be found in diets that include meat, or synthesized endogenously from lysine and methionine. Deficiencies can be caused by genetic disorders, malnutrition, malabsorption, and kidney dialysis. These can affect the heart, skeletal muscles, liver, nerve, and endocrine functions. Carnitine is marketed as a dietary supplement to enhance physical performance and to treat fatigue, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, chronic fatigue syndrome, liver disorders, and cancer.Animal models suggest that L-carnitine has cardioprotective  and antioxidant effects . It may help prevent cardiovascular disease in hemodialysis patients . Long-term carnitine supplementation in humans is correlated with improved myocardial mechanical performance, reduction in ventricular arrhythmias, and increased exercise tolerance . However, L-carnitine administration did not improve risk of death or heart failure in patients with anterior acute myocardial infarction Preliminary results suggest L-carnitine may improve symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome  and physical performance in patients undergoing dialysis for end-stage renal disease , but data of its benefits in alleviating fatigue associated with multiple sclerosis are inconclusive . Several trials have shown enhanced physical performance , and improved aerobic capacity and exercise tolerance . Other studies show mixed results  and its clinical value and safety needs additional study.L-carnitine used by itself or in combination with clomiphene citrate may help in the treatment against idiopathic male infertility , although it did not improve sperm count or motility There are studies looking into the effects of carnitine in cancer patients. L-carnitine supplementation improved nutritional status and quality of life in pancreatic cancer patients . Other preliminary data show that L-carnitine by itself  or in combination with Coenzyme Q10 may relieve chemotherapy-related fatigue. L-carnitine also demonstrated benefits against fatigue both in younger hypothyroid patients receiving levothyroxine and thyroid cancer patients who have hypothyroidism post-surgery . However, carnitine does not improve fatigue in patients with invasive malignancies . Carnitine may inhibit cisplatin-induced injury of the kidney and small intestine . Additional studies are needed to determine the cancer populations in which carnitine supplementation may be most beneficial.An ester derivative, acetyl-L-carnitine, is also available as a dietary supplement and is often used as a neuroprotective agent. It may help to reduce diabetic neuropathy  or improve cognition in patients with severe hepatic encephalopathy . In elderly patients with dysthymic disorder, it was found to be comparable with fluoxetine ; however, other studies did not find it effective for Alzheimer’s disease . One study actually showed that acetyl-L-carnitine can increase chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) . Therefore, patients receiving chemotherapy should avoid this product.",

      "Mechanism of Action": "Carnitine is a non-essential amino acid, with only the L-isomer utilized in human bodies. It is available in many foods, and bioavailability from dietary sources is much higher (54–87%) than from oral supplements (14%–18%) . L-carnitine plays a role in the transport of long chain fatty acids across the inner mitochondrial membrane, facilitating beta-oxidation of fatty acids and acting as an intracellular energy reservoir of acetyl groups. In deficiencies, these acyl esters accumulate and cause deleterious effects including inhibition of adenine nucleotide translocase, which impedes ATP production . Carnitine supplementation prevents oxidative stress and ameliorates mitochondrial function . L-carnitine demonstrated a protective effect against statin-induced cellular damage via its anti-oxidative properties in rat hepatocytes Animal studies show L-carnitine has cardioprotective effects by preventing skeletal muscle myopathy . In hemodialysis patients, carnitine has antiinflammatory and anticoagulation effects which may contribute to its cardioprotective activity In cardiac disease models, carnitine supplementation improved cardiac performance including improved myocardial metabolic patterns, reduced necrosis, diminished enzymatic infarct size, and preserved left ventricular function . Its effects on congestive heart failure-associated myopathy may be due to caspase inhibition and decreased TNF-alpha levels . Metabolism of dietary L-carnitine by intestinal microbiota produced trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), a proatherogenic species, which accelerated atherosclerosis Carnitine is often proposed for the treatment of obesity and metabolic syndrome. Possible mechanisms include inhibition of stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 activity, β-oxidation of fatty acids, and increased storage in the body tissues Animal studies show L-carnitine has anticatabolic effects by improving nitrogen balance either via increased protein synthesis or reduced protein degradation. Other studies show it prevents oxidative stress and ameliorates mitochondrial function . It may help cancer-related cachexia by reducing proteasome activity . Clinical trials are needed to determine the implications of this study in humans.In one trial, carnitine was shown to be effective in reversing hyperthyroidism by acting as a peripheral antagonist of thyroid hormone action ",

      "How It Works": "Cascara is a strong laxative. It has not been shown to treat or prevent cancer.\nCascara is made out of the bark of the Cascara sagrada plant. It is known to stimulate the large intestine and produce a well-documented laxative effect. Cascara also causes water and electrolytes (such as sodium and potassium) to flow into the large intestine and be expelled from the body with the feces. This facilitates bowel passage but also can lead to dangerously low potassium and sodium levels if cascara is used for prolonged periods of time. Scientists have isolated a compound called aloe-emodin from cascara. In laboratory studies, this compound is able to inhibit the growth of tumor cells by halting cell division, but it is unknown if this effect would take place in the human body. Scientists have also studied whether cascara might be a carcinogen, with inconsistent results.Cascara is one of the ingredients in the Hoxsey herbal therapy, which is promoted for cancer. There is no evidence that the Hoxsey herbal therapy is effective in treating cancer.",
      "Purported Uses": [
        [
          "To relieve constipation",
          "Scientific evidence supports this use, but prolonged use is not recommended because it can lead to dangerous blood electrolyte imbalances. The FDA warns that cascara is not safe to use as a laxative."
        ],
        [
          "To treat cancer",
          "Laboratory studies show that a compound found in cascara, aloe-emodin, has anticancer activity, but laboratory results are often not transferable to the human body. Clinical trials have not yet been conducted."
        ]
      ],
      "Patient Warnings": [
        "Long-term use or overdose of cascara can cause electrolyte imbalances, characterized by very low blood levels of potassium, sodium, and chloride. It may lead to liver injury. The FDA has warned that cascara is not safe to use as a laxative.",
        "Cascara may be a carcinogen (cancer-causing substance).",
        "Certain compounds in cascara can discolor urine and interfere with urinalysis."

          "drugs that are substrates of P-Glycoprotein (P-Gp):",
          "Emodin, a compound present in cascara inhibits P-Gp, and may affect how these drugs are absorbed or metabolized."
        ]
      ],
      "Side Effects": "Reported: Fresh cascara contains anthrones, which may cause vomiting and intestinal cramps.Toxicity: Excessive use can cause diarrhea and weakness.Rare: Cascara has been associated with cholestatic hepatitis (liver disease characterized by impairment of bile flow).Case Report: Toxic hepatitis (inflammation of the liver) has been been reported with use of cascara.",

      "Scientific Name": "Rhamnus purshiana",
      "Clinical Summary": "Cascara sagrada is a species of buckthorn plant native to North America. The bark of the plant has been used to relieve constipation. The major constituents are cascarosides that stimulate the large intestine and produce a laxative effect.\nIn vitro studies indicate that emodin, one of the constituents of cascara, has hepatoprotective , neuroprotective , anti-osteoporotic  and chemopreventive effects . Emodin also enhances the cytotoxic effects of some chemotherapeutic agents . Human studies have not been conducted to confirm these effects.Prolonged use or overdose of cascara can cause diarrhea, electrolyte imbalance, and hepatitis . According to the United States Food and Drug Administration, cascara has not been shown to be safe nor effective as a laxative drug . Despite this FDA ruling, cascara continues to be marketed as a dietary supplement. It is also used as an ingredient in the Hoxsey herbal formula, an ineffective alternative cancer treatment.",
      "Food Sources": "Food flavoring agent",
      "Purported Uses2": [
        "Cancer treatment",
        "Constipation"
      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "Cascarosides, the major constituents, stimulate the large intestine and produce a well-documented laxative effect. Cascarosides increase intestinal motility and lead to propulsive contractions. This results in an increased water and electrolyte content in the lumen, which further facilitates bowel passage. The other constituent emodin has direct excitatory effect on circular smooth muscle cells in the large intestine Emodin may play a protective role against osteoporosis. It was shown to suppress the receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclast differentiation of bone marrow macrophages (BMMs), and the bone resorption of mature osteoclasts via inhibiting expression of RANKL-induced NF-κB, c-Fos, and NFATc1 \nThe emodin and aloe-emodin in cascara also demonstrate anticancer properties. In vitro studies show that aloe-emodin induces expression of p53 and p21 resulting in cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase . However, more studies are needed to confirm this effect. Studies on the carcinogenic effects of cascara have produced conflicting results ",
      "Warnings": "Chronic use may cause electrolyte imbalance, especially hypokalemia.The FDA ruled that cascara is not safe as a stimulant laxative",
      "Adverse Reactions": "Reported: Fresh cascara contains anthrones, which may cause vomiting and intestinal cramps.Toxicity: Excessive use can cause diarrhea and weakness.Rare: Cascara has been associated with cholestatic hepatitis Case Report: Toxic hepatitis has been been reported with use of cascara ",
      "Herb-Drug Interactions": "P-Glycoprotein (P-Gp): Emodin inhibits the activity of P-Glycoprotein in vitro and in vivo, and may affect the transport of drugs mediated by this protein ",

      "Mechanism of Action": "The oxindole alkaloids have immunostimulating properties in vitro, increasing phagocytotic activity and synthesis of WBCs  and enhancing T-helper cell function . Inhibition of TNF-alpha production  has been linked to observed anti-inflammatory activities. Mitraphylline isolated from cat’s claw was also identified as possessing anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting the release of interleukins 1α, 1β, 4, 17, and TNF-α Acqueous extracts of cat’s claw were shown to enhance DNA repair after chemical-induced damage . Protection against oxidative DNA damage following UVB exposure may occur via enhanced base excision repair and inherent antioxidant effects . The biphasic manner in which cat’s claw modulates anxiety, initially inducing and then reversing these effects after long-term administration, is attributed to the presence of many alkaloids and flavonols Quinovic acid glycosides purified fraction of cat’s claw inhibits the growth of human bladder cancer cell lines by inducing apoptosis through modulation of NF-κB . Cat’s claw also inhibits lactate dehydrogenase-A, an enzyme that is highly expressed in diverse human malignant and treatment-resistant tumors with clinically poor outcomes . In vivo studies demonstrate antineoplastic effects against breast tumors due to modulation of oxidative stress and synergy among constituents with antioxidant properties, rather than alkaloid activity ",
      "Contraindications": "Should be avoided perioperatively and for those on immunosuppressant therapy ",
      "Adverse Reactions": "GI complaints: nausea, diarrhea, stomach discomfort Case reports\nAcute renal failure: In a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) \nWorsening motor signs: In a 38-year-old patient with Parkinson’s disease following oral intake of cat’s claw extract, with improvement in symptoms after cessation and withdrawal ",

      "Clinical Summary": "Coral calcium is derived from the natural matrix of coral. Coral particles that drift to the sea bottom from natural erosion are harvested from a wide region of tropical oceans. Coral has been used in the Ayurvedic system of medicine either alone or in polyherbal formulas for its high calcium content, to treat conditions such as inflammation, cough, and osteoporosis . Coral calcium has been marketed as both a natural calcium supplement and linked to longevity in the elderly in Okinawa, Japan. However, some studies suggest that this longevity is attributable to their traditional plant-based diet In a rodent model of postmenopausal bone loss, effects with dietary coral calcium were comparable to a calcium carbonate control . A few animal studies have been conducted with coral calcium hydride, a hydrogen-rich form of coral calcium considered to have increased antioxidant potential. In obese rodents, it prevented fatty liver disease Limited studies suggest that calcium of coral origin is better absorbed in the intestine than calcium from other sources, and thought to be due to the 2:1 calcium:magnesium ratio that occurs naturally in coral . Claims of coral calcium’s ability to maintain a proper pH balance in the human body are unsubstantiated.There is no evidence of anticancer properties of coral calcium. Oral coral calcium supplements should not be confused with the coral matrix used in surgery and bone grafting.For more information on calcium supplementation, please read our monograph on calcium",

      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "Corals contain 20% calcium and 10% magnesium by weight. This ratio is comparable to the recommended daily allowances of these two minerals In postmenopausal animal models of bone loss, coral calcium increased both bone-forming (osteocalcin, P1NP, ALP) and bone-resorption (Trap5b, CTX) markers to protect against post-ovariectomy bone loss, but effects were largely similar to those with calcium carbonate Coral calcium hydride, a hydrogen-rich form considered to have increased antioxidant potential, prevented accelerated senescence in rodents through upregulation of cell death, free radical scavenging, and molecular transport . In obese rodents, it improved hepatic mitochondrial dysfunction, reduced oxidative stress, and activated phase II enzymes to prevent fatty liver disease ",

      "Clinical Summary": "Chitosan (KY-to-san) is a derivative of chitin, extracted from the exoskeleton of crustaceans, including shrimp, lobster, and clams, and from the cell wall of Reishi mushrooms. Chitosan is used as an excipient in pharmaceutical formulations and in biomedical applications including wound dressings. It is also made into an edible film to protect food from spoilage . Chitosan is marketed as an all-natural marine fiber for weight loss management and to manage cholesterol.Animal models suggest antiobesity properties with chitosan  and derivative products . In one animal study, a combination of capsaicin and chitosan increased this activity Findings from human studies are conflicting. Although marketers of weight loss supplements claim that chitosan can bind with fat in the intestine, some clinical trials did not find any increase in fecal excretion of fat or weight loss compared with placebo . Other studies have had more positive results in combination with additional products or interventions. In a double-blind randomized controlled trial (RCT), polyglucosamine, a low molecular weight chitosan, along with a low-calorie diet and increased exercise for at least 6 months yielded additional weight loss compared with placebo and the same diet/lifestyle changes . Chitosan in combination with L-ascorbic acid produced some effects on bodyweight in overweight women, but there were no significant differences in fat mass, percentage body fat, body circumference, or skinfold thickness compared with placebo control . One single-blind RCT of fungal chitosan found significant bodyweight reductions and improved hemoglobin A1c, body composition, and anthropometric parameters in overweight/obese adults without diet restriction compared with placebo after 3 months . Howevever, due to heterogeneity of studies and mixed results, more trials are needed before definitive conclusions can be drawn.In diabetic patients, chitosan reduced low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol , and decreased weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, and triglycerides . A systematic review also concluded that chitosan reduces total cholesterol, but larger RCTs are necessary to determine its effect on other lipoproteins Chitosan may increase total plasma antioxidant activity and lower the indices of oxidative stress in humans . Limited clinical data are available regarding efficacy for anemia or chronic renal failure, although chitosan did show benefit in a small randomized study Reported adverse events include constipation and gastrointestinal distress . Patients allergic to shellfish or mushrooms should use related supplements with caution.",

        "High cholesterol",
        "Weight loss",
        "Wound healing"
      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "Chitosan is a natural polysaccharide that consists of glucosamine and N-acetylglucosamine copolymers . It has been described as biodegradable, nontoxic, non-immunogenic, and biocompatible , with properties similar to cellulose In an in vitro study, chitosan demonstrated antioxidant effects by reducing albumin carobonyls and hydroperoxides in a time-dependent manner In animal models, antiobesity effects may occur through serum leptin and C-reactive protein modulation  or 5’ adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation and lipogenesis-associated gene inhibition . In porcine models, chitosan altered genes influencing appetite and feeding behavior in the small intestine (NPY), adipose tissue (Leptin), and the brain (HCRT, INSR, NMB, GHR, PPARG, NPY5R. It also downregulated FABP2 gene expression, increased serum leptin, and significantly altered gut microbial populations . In high-fat diet-induced obese rodents, chitosan oligosaccharides improved dyslipidemia and prevented body weight gain by inhibiting adipocyte differentiation . As an insoluble fiber, low molecular weight chitosan polyglucosamines can bind to fat in the intestinal lumen, forming a complex that is partially utilized by colon bacteria and partially eliminated , but appropriate concentrations are needed. In one of these animal studies, it was suggested that the more likely mechanisms for weight loss could include bacterial energy wasting, as increased acetate and glucose excretion were also present, suggesting that larger amounts of lipids and glucose were available as fuel for bacteria in the colon Hypocholesterolemic effects from chitosan in murine models were not due to reduced cholesterol absorption efficiency or increases in fecal sterol output, so that a major bile acid-binding capacity was ruled out . The more likely scenario is that the fiber’s influence on satiation and satiety reduces food intake suppression and therefore cholesterol Human studies suggest that it is unlikely that chitosan binds fat in intestines, and could therefore not support this purported mechanism of action Topical application enhances wound healing by stimulation of granulation tissue.

      "How It Works": "Chromium may help to regulate blood glucose in some people, but the long-term effects are unknown. There is no clear evidence to show that chromium supplementation is effective for improving glucose metabolism, losing weight, or building muscle mass.\nChromium is an element required by the body in very small amounts (0.025 mg a day). Adequate amounts are usually obtained in the diet from foods such as American cheese, meat, fish, fruits, and whole grains. Based on laboratory experiments, scientists think that chromium is involved in maintaining adequate levels of glucose, fats, and insulin activity in the body. Chromium may interact with insulin receptors and enhance the effects of insulin on cells, including improved glucose uptake. In theory, this could help patients with type 2 diabetes.\nChromium is sometimes combined with GTF (Glucose Tolerance Factor) in over-the-counter products. GTF is a yeast extract that helps with glucose metabolism in laboratory studies, but this effect has not been confirmed in humans.",

      "Clinical Summary": "Chromium is a trace element that is necessary for glucose, insulin, and lipid metabolism in humans . It is marketed as a dietary supplement for diabetes, weight loss, and to improve muscle mass. Trivalent chromium from yeast extract is sometimes referred to as glucose tolerance factor (GTF) in over-the-counter products.Although most people consume adequate amounts through diet, chromium deficiency has been implicated in the development of diabetes . In vitro studies suggest that chromium produces beneficial modulatory effects under hyperglycemic conditions . Animal models also suggest antidiabetic , antidepressant , and anxiolytic  properties.In human studies, chromium supplementation with biotin may help to improve glycemic control in type 2 diabetes (T2D) . In a trial of patients with poorly controlled T2D, chromium supplementation had beneficial effects on glycemic control without affecting lipid profiles . Another study showed that chromium picolinate may increase satiety . However, many clinical studies failed to demonstrate a beneficial effect of chromium on glucose metabolism, weight loss, or muscle mass improvement Due to lack of clinical evidence, the FDA stated that chromium picolinate did not reduce the risk of insulin resistance or type-2 diabetes . More recently, the debate has continued, with one meta-analysis determining that overall, chromium monosupplementation significantly improved glycemic control, increased HDL-C levels, and reduced triglycerides , while another meta-analysis determined that chromium picolinate did not significantly affect A1C, and had no effect on fasting plasma glucose . Other clinicians posit that the mixed and modest effect sizes seen with chromium supplementation may reflect a greater glucoregulatory effect in complex patients with comorbid diabetes, depression, and binge eating . A large population study determined that those who consumed chromium-containing supplements had a reduced risk of T2D compared with those who did not, and warranted further study given the magnitude of exposure In other studies, chromium picolinate supplementation improved cerebral and memory function in elderly patients with early memory decline , produced antidepressant effects in patients with atypical depression , and improved mood symptoms in patients with premenstrual dysphoric disorder Chromium is poorly absorbed following oral administration, but salt forms such as chromium picolinate, niacin-bound chromium, and chromium chloride, appear to have better bioavailability. Other novel chromium compounds also have improved bioavailability . Adverse effects are rare but can include renal failure , rhabdomyolysis , liver damage , and dermatitis ",
      "Food Sources": "Liver, American cheese, broccoli, brewer’s yeast, wheat germ, meat, eggs, chicken, fish, fruits, whole grains, brown sugar, alfalfa, and animal fats ",
      "Purported Uses2": [
        "Diabetes",
        "Depression",
        "Strength and stamina",
        "Weight loss"
      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "Chromium is an essential trace element involved with glucose and lipid metabolism, circulating insulin levels, and the peripheral activity of insulin . In vitro and in vivo studies suggest that chromium potentiates the activity of insulin . This is thought to occur via enhanced intracellular tyrosine kinase activity that results from an interaction between chromium, low molecular weight chromium-binding substance, and activated cell surface insulin receptors In animal models of diabetes, chromium recovered beta cell functioning and alleviated macroangiopathy . It also augmented the insulin signaling pathway, dulled negative-regulators of insulin signaling, enhanced adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity to increase cellular glucose uptake, and attenuated oxidative stress . Chromium may also modulate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma), insulin receptor substrate (IRS-1), and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) proteins . Antidepressant effects occur via modified brain 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor (5-HT) function and increased serotonergic and noradrenergic functioning . Additional mechanisms for antidepressant and anxiolytic effects include the lowering of plasma corticosterone levels via reversal of hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis (HPA) axis overactivity . In humans, suggested antidepressant mechanisms include 5HT2A downregulation and increased insulin sensitivity ",
      "Contraindications": "Patients with liver or renal insufficiency may have increased susceptibility to adverse effects ",
      "Adverse Reactions": "Rare: Hepatic toxicity Case reports Renal failure: In a 33-year-old white woman who also presented with weight loss, anemia, thrombocytopenia, hemolysis, and liver dysfunction after chronic high doses of chromium picolinate to enhance weight loss  ; and in a 49-year-old female nurse who took chromium picolinate 600 mcg daily for 6 weeks for weight reduction Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis: Characterized by erythematous lesions, fever, edema, leukocytosis, and eosinophilia Rhabdomyolysis: In a 24-year old patient taking chromium picolinate in addition to other dietary supplements Hypoglycemia: In a 29-year-old man with T2D after ingesting oral chromium 1000 mcg daily in addition to taking insulin ",

      "How It Works": "Chrysanthemum has not been shown to treat or prevent cancer.Chrysanthemum is a flowering plant from the sunflower family. It has been used in traditional medicine for centuries, but little research has been conducted. Lab studies suggest it may be useful to develop as a therapy for bone diseases and diabetes. Some studies indicate that chrysanthemum extracts can kill cancer cells in the lab, but it is not known whether this effect occurs in the human body.Patients receiving drugs to suppress the immune system should avoid this botanical as it may increase the adverse effects associated with these drugs.",

      "Clinical Summary": "Chrysanthemum is a perennial flowering plant from the Asteraceae family that is native to Asia and northeastern Europe. The flower and aerial parts of many species are used in traditional medicine to treat hypertension, angina, fever, and various inflammatory diseases.In vitro and animal studies indicate cytotoxic  , antioxidant , antibacterial , anti-inflammatory , immunomodulatory  , antiosteoporotic , and neuroprotective  properties. Various species also have antidiabetic , antihyperlipidemic , and anti-atherosclerotic  effects.In laboratory studies, Chrysanthemum reversed multidrug resistance in human breast cancer cells  . This botanical or its constituents have also displayed anti-angiogenic  and antiproliferative activities . In animal models, C. morifolium displayed benefits against cachexia . Clinical trials have yet to be conducted to determine these effects in humans.",

        "Common cold",
        "Fever",
        "Hypertension",
        "Inflammation"
      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "Antioxidant effects have been attributed to various constituents, including phenolic compounds and chlorogenic acids . Anti-inflammatory mechanisms include inhibition of nitric oxide production and tumor necrosis factor-alpha secretion . In vitro, anti-osteoporotic activity of phenolic and flavonoid compounds from C. indicum flowers was linked to tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) activity . Another C. indicum extract inhibited formation of TRAP-positive mature osteoclasts, disrupted bone resorption, and enhanced primary osteoblast differentiation via upregulation of alkaline phosphatase expression and extracellular calcium concentrations . A C. zawadskii ethanol extract inhbited osteoclastogenesis through suppression of ERK activation and other mechanisms to negatively regulate osteoclast differentiation. In diabetes-associated bone disease, C. zawadskii attenuation of dRib-induced cell damage in MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells was attributed to antioxidant activity and effects on differentiation related to bone recovery In animal models, handelin from C. boreale produced anti-inflammatory effects that were linked to downregulation of NF-kappaB signaling and pro-inflammatory cytokine production . A polyphenol-rich C. morifolium extract inhibited hyperlipidemic fatty liver in mice through the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-alpha-mediated pathway . Chrysanthemum significantly decreased serum IgE, IgG1, IL-4, and IFN-γ levels and reduced mRNA levels of IFN-γ, IL-4, and IL-13 in dorsal skin lesions Chrysanthemum reversed multidrug resistance in human breast cancer cells via inhibition of P-glycoprotein activity  . It induced apoptosis in various tumor cells via inhibition of JAK1/2 and STAT3 signaling pathways  . Antiproliferative effects in lung cancer cells were attributed to suppression of the Akt-dependent signaling pathway by the constituent linarin . In animal models, C. morifolium demonstrated anti-cachectic effects by acting as a PPAR-gamma ligand that attenuated skeletal muscle changes in tumor-bearing mice ",
      "Contraindications": [

Subsequent analysis determined that among the constituents in the tea, the strongest inhibitor of CYP3A4, the enzyme by which these drugs are metabolized, was chrysanthemum . Other constituents that also had an inhibitory effect included dandelionliquorice and bishop’s weed.",
      "Herb-Drug Interactions": "Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 substrates: Chrysanthemum extracts are known to induce  and inhibit CYP3A4 activities  resulting in changes in blood levels of substrate drugs.P-Glycoprotein (P-gp) substrates: Chrysanthemum inhibited P-gp, resulting in increased intracellular concentrations of substrate drugs ",

      "How It Works": "Coenzyme Q10 has not been shown to treat or prevent cancer.\nCoenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is produced naturally by all cells in the body. It is necessary for production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the “fuel” of all living cells. During periods of ischemia (lack of oxygen), such as occurs during a heart attack, CoQ10 has been shown to reduce damage to heart tissue and its mitochondria (where ATP production takes place). It is known to be an antioxidant and to stabilize cell and organelle membranes. In animal studies, coenzyme Q10 is able to neutralize free radicals, which can damage DNA and cells. However, absorption of oral coenzyme Q10 through the intestine is low.Due to its antioxidant activity, CoQ10 may interfere with the actions of certain chemotherapy drugs and radiation therapy.",

      "Brand Name": "UbiQgel™",
      "Scientific Name": "2,3 dimethoxy-5 methyl-6-decaprenyl benzoquinone",
      "Clinical Summary": "Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), also known as ubiquinone, is involved in cellular respiration and energy production. It is found in all human cells, at higher concentrations in the liver, kidney, heart, and pancreas. It is also consumed as a dietary supplement for its antioxidant effects and is often promoted as a preventive agent for cardiovascular diseases, Parkinson’s disease, infertility and cancer. Studies using murine models indicate antioxidant and neuroprotective effects ,  and the ability to alleviate radiation-induced nephropathy Data from clinical trials suggest beneficial effects of CoQ10 in patients with coronary artery disease  and congestive heart failure . Supplementation may increase sperm motility in asthenozoospermic men ; modulate expression of insulin, lipid and inflammatory markers in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (POCS) ; and reduce fatigue induced by physical exertion . In addition, neuroprotective effects were reported in patients with progressive supranuclear palsy  as well as those with early Parkinson’s disease , but not in patients with mid-stage Parkinson’s disease . Case reports also suggest that CoQ10 supplementation improves postural hypotension, a hallmark of multiple-system atrophy  But a mixture of antioxidants, including CoQ10, vitamins C, E, and lipoic acid was found ineffective against Alzheimer’s disease \nCoQ10 may also play a role in preventing migraines . A small study showed a reduction in the frequency of migraine headaches following supplementation , but a randomized trial failed to find benefit . More research is warranted. Further, the observation that patients on statin therapy have decreased concentrations of CoQ10 in muscle cells  resulted in efforts to evaluate the benefit of CoQ10 in alleviating statin-induced myalgias. Data are inconclusive \nCoQ10 has also been investigated for anticancer effects. In a study of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, coenzyme Q10 levels were positively associated with antioxidant capacity and negatively correlated with inflammation markers, post surgery , suggesting a role for CoQ10 as an antioxidant therapy. In studies of breast cancer patients, a combination of CoQ10 and L-carnitine was found effective in controlling moderate-severe cancer-related fatigue (CRF) . And according to case reports, supplementation may be useful for treating the cancer , although a randomized trial reported no benefit in improving self-reported fatigue or quality of life . Further study is needed \nCoQ10 may interfere with the actions of warfarin . Because of its antioxidant property, CoQ10 may also reduce effectiveness of chemotherapy and radiation therapy ",

      "Mechanism of Action": "CoQ10 is known to have antioxidant and membrane stabilizing properties and is the only endogenously produced lipid with a redox function in mammals. All cells are capable of synthesizing CoQ10 and no redistribution between organs occurs through the blood. It is necessary for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production, and its role as a mobile electron carrier in the mitochondrial electron-transfer processes of respiration and coupled phosphorylation is well established. It also has a direct regulatory role on succinyl and NADH dehydrogenases . CoQ10 has been shown to scavenge free radicals produced by lipid peroxidation and prevent mitochondrial deformity during episodes of ischemia, and it may help maintain the integrity of myocardial calcium ion channels during ischemic insults . CoQ10 may also be capable of stabilizing cellular membranes and preventing depletion of metabolites required for ATP resynthesis , and suppressing age-related inflammatory reactions and osteoclast differentiation by inhibiting oxidative stress One of the mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effects of CoQ10 involves inhibition of microglia in pentylenetetrazol-induced kindling epilepsy in mice \nIn addition, CoQ10 was shown to prevent the reduction of glucose transporter-4 (GLUT4) protein levels in adipocytes caused by simvastatin, which is a likely mechanism against statin-induced diabetes . It also reduced high glucose-induced apoptosis and dysfunction of endothelial progenitor cells by up-regulating endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and heme oxygenase (HO-1) through the AMP-activated protein kinase pathway . In a  murine model, it was shown to afford protection against doxorubicin-induced testicular toxicity by ameliorating oxidative stress, reducing apoptosis and by up-regulating testicular P-glycoprotein ",

However, there are reports that CoQ10 can increase the risk of bleeding when used with warfarin Theophylline: CoQ10 delays the clearance of theophylline, which can cause persistent vomiting, cardiac arrhythmias, and intractable seizures ",

Taking too much colloidal silver by mouth can cause skin discoloration, seizures, and kidney damage.\nColloidal silver is a suspension of tiny silver particles in a liquid. Silver compounds are used externally to stop or prevent infections but recently, many people have started taking colloidal silver as an alternative medicine. It is being promoted as a cure for cancer, diabetes, and AIDS although there is no proof it works in humans. Our body does not need silver to function normally. Silver actually denatures proteins and can make many enzymes lose their effects.Long-term oral use of silver can make the skin turn bluish-gray or gray-black in color. It can also cause seizures and kidney damage. Pregnant women should not consume colloidal silver as it has harmful effects on the fetus.",

      "Clinical Summary": "Colloidal silver consists of silver particles suspended in a liquid. It is often produced by home-made generators. The use of silver medicinals to treat disorders such as epilepsy, gonorrhea, and colds was not uncommon until the mid-20th century. However, silver was replaced by safer therapies in the recent decades. Silver is not an essential mineral and does not serve any physiological function in the body. It denatures proteins by binding to their reactive groups and can inactivate some enzymes by forming hemisilver sulfides with sulfhydryl groups of the enzymes . Whereas silver compounds are still used in external preparations as antiseptics, there has been a growing interest in using the colloidal form of silver orally as an alternative medicine. In vitro studies indicate antitumor effects , but no human clinical data support the use of oral colloidal silver. However, despite lack of evidence, it is being promoted as a cure for AIDS, cancer, and diabetes.\nWhen taken orally, silver can interact with and reduce the effectiveness of tetracycline, quinolone, and penicillamine. Long term use can cause silver deposition in the skin and mucous membranes leading to an irreversible condition called argyria, characterized by bluish-gray to gray-black pigmentation . Other adverse effects include seizures  and kidney damage. Pregnant women should not consume colloidal silver as it can cause developmental abnormalities in the fetus ",

      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "Silver is unstable in suspension form and can bind to proteins. Silver compounds form hemisilver sulfides with sulfhydryl groups that leads to inactivation of enzymes. Silver also has the ability to bind amino, carboxyl, phosphate and imidazole groups . Studies have shown that silver accumulates in rat liver and binds with various tissues and basal membranes. It also affects the activities of lactate dehydrogenase and glutathione peroxidase and the peroxidation of membrane lipids ",

      "Clinical Summary": "Conjugated Linoleic Acid (CLA) is a naturally occurring fatty acid found in the milk and meat of ruminant animals . CLA supplements have been marketed for weight control and to lower high cholesterol. Other purported uses include cancer prevention. CLA has different isomers that appear to have distinct characteristics, with anti-carcinogenic effects more likely attributable to cis-9,trans-11 and anti-obesity effects attributable to the trans-10,cis-12  isomer.In humans, studies of potential benefits of CLA are mixed. CLA supplemenation may have antithrombotic or antiatherosclerotic effects . However, in obese men at high risk for cardiovascular disease, cis-9,trans-11 CLA supplementation decreased insulin sensitivity . Another study suggests no significant effects on antioxidant metabolism in healthy overweight/obese individuals . CLA may ameliorate inflammatory bowel disease  and improve airway hyperreactivity in asthmatic individuals . Short-term high CLA intake did not affect blood pressure regulation Data from studies on CLA-induced changes in body composition and weight reduction are also mixed. Some studies yielded positive results  while others do not show benefits . Several double-blind RCTs have evaluated whether CLA can have additional effects on exercise performance. One study did not find any impact of CLA on aerobic capacity , and another determined that CLA did not improve aerobically-induced neuromuscular fatigue . However, CLA was shown to have triacylglycerol-lowering effects both on its own  and along with aerobic exercise , although it did not have any effect on other lipoprotein risk factors Animal studies suggest that CLA may play a role in reducing tumor proliferation in certain cancer cell lines . In models of colorectal cancer, CLA reduced inflammation and decreased disease activity . Preliminary human studies suggest anticancer effects with CLA in colorectal  and breast  cancers. More studies in the context of clinical trials are needed.Reported adverse events include minor gastrointestinal symptoms  and severe fatigue ",

      "Mechanism of Action": "Of several possible CLA isomers, cis-9,trans-11 and trans-10,cis-12 are the main isomers found in meat and dairy products, as well as commercial supplements. They appear to have distinct characteristics, with anti-carcinogenic effects more likely attributable to cis-9,trans-11 and anti-obesity effects attributable to trans-10,cis-12 CLA reduced prostaglandin synthesis, especially PGE2 , and decreased stearoyl-CoA desaturase activity . The trans-10,cis-12 isomer decreased serum HDL cholesterol levels , inhibited stearoyl-CoA desaturase activity , and decreased insulin-like growth factor-II secretion at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels Laboratory and animal studies suggest that CLA has both anti- and pro-oxidant effects . CLA may reduce abdominal adiposity through increased energy expenditure, while myocardial oxidative stress may occur through changes in transmembrane potential or the antioxidant defense system In humans, CLA appeared to have a synergistic effect with a mixture of oleic and erucic acids in reducing neuroinflammation and enhancing peroxisomal beta-oxidation . In human skeletal muscle, CLA enhanced the rate of glycogen resynthesis after exercise It is thought that replacing other polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) with CLA may reduce oxidative stress and modulate intracellular signaling . These effects may inhibit carcinogenesis and affect cellular responses to tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) . In vitro, CLA inhibited MCF-7 breast cancer cell proliferation, but the mechanisms by which this occurred for both isomers (trans-10,cis-12 and cis-9,trans-11) differed and require future elucidation . The cis-9,trans-11 isomer induced tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 and TIMP-2 mRNA in SGC-7901 human gastric carcinoma cells, which may play a role in inhibiting the tumor metastasis cascade . This inhibition may come from blocking the cell cycle with reduced expressions of cyclin A, B1 and D1 and enhanced cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CDKI) expression In animal models of colorectal cancer, suppression of disease activity was attributed to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARy) activation . Other possible mechanisms include increased apoptosis and enhanced caspase-3 activity in the colon mucosa . Preliminary studies in human breast cancers suggest anticancer effects occurred through suppression of fatty acid synthesis . In rectal cancer, CLA supplementation may improve markers of inflammation, and reduce angiogenesis and tumor invasion via matrix metalloproteinase-9 inhibition The cis-9,trans-11 isomer may modify platelet activation and aggregation, and displayed anticoagulant properties ",
      "Contraindications": "CLA should be used with caution in patients who have cardiovascular disease or diabetes, as it has increased lipid peroxidation and caused insulin resistance / decreased insulin sensitivity ",
      "Adverse Reactions": "Fatigue, gastrointestinal symptoms ",
      "Herb-Drug Interactions": "Anticoagulant/antiplatelet drugs: The cis-9,trans-11 isomer has also been shown to have anticoagulant/antiplatelet activities . It may increase the effect of drugs with similar properties.",

But there’s not enough evidence to show it is a safe and effective cancer treatment in humans.\nField bindweed is an invasive weed found in many parts of the world. It has been used in traditional medicine but extracts from the leaves are sold as dietary supplement. These extracts contain proteoglycans that were shown to stimulate the immune system and stop the growth of new blood vessels in lab studies.   They also reduced the size of tumors in the mice.  No clinical trials in humans have been done to find out field bindweed extracts’ benefits and adverse effects. Since these extracts affect growth of new blood vessels, they may interfere with would healing,",

        [
          "To stop blood-vessel growth and shrink tumors",
          "Laboratory studies in mice and chicken eggs suggest that extracts of bindweed flowers and leaves can stop blood-vessel growth.  In mice, this caused tumors to stop growing. This effect has not been tested in humans."

      "Side Effects": "Consumption of large quantities of raw field bindweed caused side effects of the digestive system in animals.",
      "Special Point": "Field bindweed (C. arvensis) extracts have not been tested in humans as a cancer treatment. They are not substitutes for prescription anti-cancer drugs.",
      "Brand Name": "C-statin, VascuStatin",
      "Scientific Name": "Convolvulis arvensis",
      "Clinical Summary": "Convolvulis arvensis, commonly known as field bindweed, is a plant that belongs to the morning glory family. It is a perennial vine with white to pink flowers that can be found in temperate regions. C. arvensis is considered a noxious weed in US farmlands due to its invasive nature but has historical use as a medicinal plant in Europe for hypertension and as a laxative , and in traditional Chinese medicine for relief of itching, pain, and toothache \nThe leaf extract is marketed as a dietary supplement to support vascular health by restricting new blood vessel growth. However, related products are also promoted as a natural cancer treatment.\nRecent in vitro and animal studies show that the water extracts from the plant’s aerial parts, rich in proteoglycans, have anti-angiogenic and immune-stimulating effects . Other studies found that these constituents also increased vasodilation and circulatory function, and lowered blood pressure in animals \nAlkaloids from raw field bindweed are toxic to animals  but dietary supplements are alkaloid-free.\nDue to its ability to inhibit new blood vessel growth, C. arvensis should not be used before and after surgery. Infants, children, adolescents, and pregnant women should also avoid this product.",
      "Mechanism of Action": "Water extract from the aerial parts of C. arvensis is thought to be rich in proteoglycans. It exerts immunostimulatory effects in animals by increasing total leukocyte and lymphocyte counts as well as increasing serum lysosome activity . The lipophilic glycoside constituents have cytotoxic effects in human tumor cell lines . High molecular weight extract from C. arvensis inhibits tumor growth in a dose-dependent manner probably due to its ability to inhibit growth of blood vessels \nAnimal studies show that the tropane alkaloids from C. arvensis have anti-muscarinic activity that slows gastrointestinal motility. This may increase the absorption of toxins leading to intestinal fibrosis gastritis and/or hepatitis ",
      "Contraindications": "C. arvensis leaf extract inhibits vascular development , and can, theoretically interfere with wound healing.",
      "Adverse Reactions": "Reported: In animal studies, weight loss and intestinal pain were reported after consuming large amounts of bindweed, probably due to the tropane alkaloid contents ",
      "Herb Lab Interactions": "Leaf extracts of C. arvensis have anti-angiogenic activities , and may increase the risk of adverse effects when used with other anti-angiogenic agents, such as bevacizumab.",

      "Scientific Name": "Coriolus versicolor, Trametes versicolor, Polyporus versicolor, Polystictus versicolor",
      "Clinical Summary": "Coriolus versicolor is a mushroom of the Basidiomycetes class. It is used in traditional Chinese medicine as a tonic, and recent studies suggest that it has immunostimulant and anti-tumor properties. Polysaccharide-K (PSK), a proprietary product derived from Coriolus, was developed for cancer treatment in Japan. When used as an adjuvant, PSK appears to improve survival rates in patients with gastric  and colorectal  cancers. It may also benefit patients with esophageal cancer . Other Coriolus extracts, such as polysaccharide-peptide (PSP) and VPS, are available as dietary supplements. One clinical study demonstrated that when used in conjunction with chemotherapy, PSP may benefit patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer . Other clinical studies using Coriolus extract alone or in combination with other botanicals also suggest positive immunomodulatory effects . However, studies on breast cancer , hepatocellular carcinoma , and leukemia  produced mixed results. A hot water extract of Coriolus, VPS, was found to enhance development of large intestinal tumors in mice Coriolus extracts are generally well tolerated but minor adverse effects have been reported. Many over-the-counter Coriolus products are not standardized, making it difficult to compare potency between brands. It is also unclear if PSK, PSP, and other Coriolus extracts have comparable effects.",

      "Mechanism of Action": "Coriolus versicolor is thought to be a biological response modifier. PSK has been found to induce cytokine expression in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells in vitro. In other studies, PSP, as well as a Coriolus extract, selectively induced apoptosis of human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells . PSP also increased apoptotic cell death in cells that had been treated with camptothecin. In these cells, PSP reduced cellular proliferation, inhibited cell progression through both the S and G2 phases of DNA replication, reduced 3H - thymidine uptake, and prolonged DNA synthesis time . An additional in vitro study showed that a medicinal mushroom blend that included Coriolus inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase in the invasive human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 . DNA-microarray analysis indicated that the mushroom extract inhibited the expression of cell cycle regulatory genes and suppressed metastatic behavior through the inhibition of cell adhesion, cell migration, and cell invasion . The inhibition of metastatic behavior was linked to the suppression of urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) . PSP has also been shown to inhibit the interaction between HIV-1 gp120 and CD4 receptor, HIV-1 transcriptase activity, and glycohydrolase enzyme activity associated with viral glycosylation Several animal studies report of synergism between PSK and biologic therapies, including a concanavalin A-bound L1210 vaccine and the IgG2a monoclonal antibody against human colon cancer cells . PSP induces cytokine production and T-cell proliferation, and prevents immune suppression due to cyclophosphamide in animal models. Peritoneal macrophages isolated from mice that were fed PSP show increased production of reactive nitrogen intermediates, superoxide anions, and tumor necrosis factor . PSP also shows analgesic activity in mouse models Non-small cell lung cancer patients have increased leukocyte and neutrophil counts, and increased serum IgG and IgM after consumption of PSP . Healthy volunteers as well as breast cancer patients who used a formula containing Coriolus and Salvia were found to have elevated counts of T-helper lymphocytes (CD4+), a high ratio of CD4+/CD8+, and elevated absolute counts of B-lymphocytes . TNF-alpha and IL-8 gene expression were also found to be significantly induced after PSK administration in healthy volunteers and gastric cancer patients, although individual response varied . PSK was shown to induce apoptosis in promyelomonocytic leukemia HL-60 cells without inducing differentiation, and p38 MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinas) was found to play an important role in this process ",
      "Adverse Reactions": "Adverse reactions from Coriolus are rare. But passage of dark colored stools (not originating from occult blood) , darkening of fingernails , and low-grade hematological and gastrointestinal toxicities have been reported when used in conjunction with chemotherapy agents . However, such effects may be caused by the chemotherapy agents themselves.",

      "How It Works": "Cranberry juice or extracts have not been shown to treat or prevent cancer. It may be helpful for urinary tract infections (UTIs) in limited populations, but there is not enough evidence to recommend it for UTI prevention.\nCranberries contain compounds known as proanthocyanidins that have been shown to prevent bacteria from attaching to the bladder wall, which could cause UTIs. Human studies suggest it may be helpful for this purpose in some limited populations, including prostate cancer patients, but overall evidence is conflicting. Cranberry may also prevent bacteria from attaching to the stomach lining and areas in the mouth. Although lab studies suggest activity with several types of cancer cells, this has yet to be confirmed in human studies.In patients who are prone to kidney stones, regular use of cranberry should be limited as it contains oxalates, a compound found in the most common form of kidney stones.",

      "Clinical Summary": "Cranberry is an evergreen shrub that is grown in North America and Europe. The processed fruit and juice, both rich in vitamin C, are widely consumed as food. The juice extract is marketed as a dietary supplement for urinary tract health and to prevent urinary tract infections (UTIs). It has also been used for oral and gastrointestinal infections, cardiovascular diseases, and against cancer.Cranberry juice extracts and constituents exhibit antibacterial , antimicrobial , antifungal , anti-inflammatory , antioxidant , and antiadherence  properties.Results with cranberry preparations for UTIs have been mixed. Clinical studies demonstrate that cranberry extracts can help prevent UTIs in adults , children , and prostate cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy . While a large double-blind study of older adults with high-baseline UTI risk suggests some benefit , another similar study yielded negative results . A subsequent analysis determined there were increased costs with no meaningful reduction in UTI rates in a geriatric nursing home environment . Studies of cranberry juice for recurrent UTIs have also been mixed, with one study finding no benefit among college-aged women , and another observing significant reductions in UTI relapse in women over age 50 . Cranberry was not as effective or cost-effective as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in preventing UTIs in premenopausal women, but patients were less likely to develop antibiotic-resistant bacteria . In volunteers from different regions, anti-adhesion activity with cranberry powder was found to be dose-dependent  . Overall, a systematic review determined that cranberry juice was more effective than capsules or tablets , but despite some support for recurrent UTI prophylaxis, there is not enough evidence to recommend cranberry juice for UTI prevention Cranberry juice inhibited the adhesion of H. pylori to human gastric mucosa , and regular consumption of cranberry juice can suppress H. pylori infection , a major factor in peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancer. When used with standard treatment, cranberry juice helps to eradicate H. pylori in women . It has also been shown to prevent plaque formation and the development of gum disease due to its anticolonizing and antiadhesion properties In vitro studies of cranberry extracts and proanthocyanidins demonstrate antiproliferative effects against prostate , liver , lung , neuroblastoma , breast , ovarian , gastric , colon , esophageal , and oral  cancer cell lines. Although cranberry juice consumption did not lower oxidative status in humans, suggesting lack of protective effect against cancer or heart disease , it did appear to improve cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors in a randomized double-blind trial of diabetic men Cranberry juice has relatively high concentrations of oxalate, a common component of kidney stones, and should therefore be limited in patients with a history of nephrolithiasis . Other data suggest it may be helpful in more uncommon forms including struvite stones, which are associated with bladder infections ",
      "Food Sources": "Cranberry can be consumed as juice, sauce, or dried fruit.",
      "Purported Uses2": [
        "Urinary tract infections",
        "Cancer prevention and treatment",
        "Ulcers",
        "Atherosclerosis",
        "Gum disease"
      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "In vitro, cranberry proanthocyanidins (C-PACs) inhibit adherence of E. coli fimbriae to uroepithelial cells . A-type linkages in these C-PACs may enhance urinary bacterial antiadhesion activities to prevent UTIs . Similarly, activity against C. albicans biofilm formation by C-PAC is due to antiadherence properties and/or iron chelation . In susceptible populations, improved preventive effects with cranberry juice over capsules or tablets may be related to better hydration with liquid, and/or additive effects with additional compounds in juice not contained in supplements Antiadhesion properties are also demonstrated in other microenvironments. Cranberry prevents H. pylori-induced stomach ulcers by inhibiting bacterial adhesions in the stomach lining . It also decreased adherence of oral streptococci strains to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite  and glucan-coated hydroxyapatite, and impaired biofilm formation  indicating it may slow dental plaque development and protect against plaque-related diseases. Cranberry may regulate aggressive human periodontitis fibroblast inflammatory responses via nuclear factor-kappaB and matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP3) inhibition C-PACs may also play a role in enhancing host innate immunity. In a worm model, a standardized cranberry extract mediated host immune response via p38 MAPK signaling, insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 signaling, and heat shock factor 1 Antiatherogenic effects with cranberry juice occur through decreases in serum glucose and apoB, and increases in serum and apoA-1 and paraoxonase, associated with stabilizing HDL In vitro, anticancer effects with cranberry extracts and C-PACs have been attributed to a number of mechanisms. Cranberry extract inhibited prostate cancer cell growth by decreasing cyclins, cyclin-dependant kinase expression  , and MMP activity . Dose-response inhibition of gastric cancer cells is in part due to decreased proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression and apoptotic induction . A proanthocyanidin isolate from cranberry may arrest ovarian cancer cell growth by inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor and generating reactive oxygen species . C-PACs induced cell death in esophageal adenocarcinoma via microRNA modifications within cancer cells . In human lung cancer cells, C-PACs also altered gene expression, induced apoptosis, and modulated cell-cycle processes . In high-risk neuroblastoma cells, a purified C-PAC induced apoptosis and ROS generation, and encouraged cyclophosphamide retention with synergistic cytotoxic benefits Increased risk of uric acid stone formation with cranberry juice results from its acidifying effect and slowing of urate synthesis, decreasing urinary pH ",
      "Contraindications": "• Cranberry products can increase urine oxalate excretion and may promote the formation of the most common type of kidney stones . Its use should therefore be limited in patients with a history of nephrolithiasis ",
      "Adverse Reactions": "Ingesting large amounts of cranberry juice (3 cups daily) has been associated with gastrointestinal upset including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea Case Reports Recurrent stones: In a 47-year-old man with severe right renal colic and hematuria who took cranberry concentrate tablets twice daily over 6 months Several cases of increased International Normalized Ratio (INR): Due to suspected interactions between warfarin and cranberry juice Internal hemorrhage and subsequent death: In 2 patients with concurrent use of warfarin and cranberry juice ",
      "Herb-Drug Interactions": "Warfarin: Cranberry juice may potentiate warfarin-induced anticoagulation, but data are conflicting . Although consumption of cranberry juice in large quantities (1–2 L daily or supplements for >3–4 weeks) may alter warfarin effects, monitoring intake rather than total avoidance of cranberry juice by warfarin users in other cases may be warranted Cyclosporin: A randomized controlled trial has shown that 240 mL of cranberry juice had no clinically significant effect on the disposition of a 200 mg dose of cyclosporin UGT (Uridine 5’-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase) substrates: Cranberry modulates UGT enzymes in vitro and can increase risk of side effects of drugs metabolized by them Cytochrome P450 substrates: Cranberry inhibits enteric CYP3A activities and may interfere with the absorption of substrate drugs . Cranberry inhibits CYP2C9 in vitro, but this activity was not observed in humans ",
      "Herb Lab Interactions": "Urinary pH has been shown to decrease after drinking cranberry juice ",

      "Clinical Summary": "Croton lechleri is a tree that is found in many regions of South America . The dark red viscous latex of this plant, also known as Sangre de Grado or Dragon’s blood, has been used in traditional medicine for diarrhea and wound healing.\nIn vitro and animal studies show that it can promote the healing of gastric ulcers , and inhibit cutaneous neurogenic inflammation . A proanthocyanidin oligomer isolated from the latex of Croton lechleri has shown benefits in the treatment of traveler diarrhea, and diarrhea experienced by AIDS patients . A similar product, crofelemer, is approved by the FDA as a prescription drug to relieve diarrhea associated with antiretroviral therapy in HIV/AIDS patients . However, in a study of AIDS patients with recurrent genital herpes, it was found no more effective than placebo Sangre de Grado demonstrated apoptotic effects in cancer cells in vitro . However, it also increased the viability of leukemic cells in vitro . Further research is needed to verify such effects.",

      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "SP-303, a mixture of proanthocyanidin oligomers was shown to inhibit cAMP-mediated chloride secretion in two intestinal epithelial cell lines (Caco-2 and T84) . The dual inhibitory action of crofelemer, a purified proanthocyanidin oligomer, on two structurally unrelated prosecretory intestinal Cl(-) channels may account for the intestinal antisecretory activity . The sap of Sangre de Grado decreased capsaicin mediated chloride secretion in vitro  by inhibiting activation of sensory afferent nerves. Sangre de Grado irreversibly altered the microtubule structure of cancer cells, resulting in an inability of the cells to adhere and in turn induced cell death via apoptosis . It also inhibited the mutagenicity of 2-Aminoanthracene, although the direct mechanism is unknown . Topical application of Taspine, an alkaloid from Sangre de Grado sap, to a wound site produced an increase in wound healing activity  and an increase in the wound tensile strength 5-7 days following injury . Taspine promotes wound healing via increase in migration of fibroblasts to the wound site  by acting as a chemotactic factor for fibroblasts ",
      "Adverse Reactions": "Localized burning sensation upon topical application.\nUpper respiratory tract infection, bronchitis, cough, flatulence, and increased levels of the liver enzyme bilirubin have been reported in a clinical study of crofelemer ",
      "Herb Lab Interactions": "Increased bilirubin has reported in clinical study using crofelemer ",

      "How It Works": "Oral cayenne may provide limited relief of mucositis pain caused by radiation treatment, but it may cause gastric side effects in certain concentrations.The capsicum pepper contains a chemical called capsaicin that is a powerful irritant.

      "Clinical Summary": "Derived from the fruit of Capsicum, cayenne is among the most widely consumed culinary spice. Traditionally, it is used as a gargle for laryngitis and orally as a gastrointestinal stimulant. Oral formulations are marketed largely for digestive and circulatory problems, poor appetite, and weight loss. The active component, capsaicin, is also marketed for topical use to relieve various types of pain and for certain skin conditions (See Capsaicin topical formulationsCapsaicin may also increase insulin and decrease blood glucose levels . Nonpungent capsaicin analogues can produce a stimulatory effect in humans, but their potential role in energy expenditure and weight management problems needs further clarification . In addition, the thermogenic and appetitive effects of capsaicin have been determined to be small . A preliminary study of enteric-coated oral capsaicin suggests it may decrease visceral hyperalgesia and improve bloating in patients with irritable bowel syndrome . Supplementation with capsicum for burning mouth syndrome is associated with significant side effects Another study of oral capsaicin in a candy suggests it can alleviate oral mucositis pain from cancer therapy, but this relief was temporary and not complete . There is continued controversy over whether active constituents of capsicum act as a carcinogen, co-carcinogen, or anti-carcinogen  , and effects may be concentration-dependent . In vitro studies have shown cytotoxic effects against breast , bladder , prostate , and oral cancer cell lines , and multidrug-resistant lymphoma . However, a human case-control study suggests an increased risk for gastric cancer with dietary capsaicin . Therefore, more studies are needed to clarify the roles of capsaicin in relationship to cancer.",

      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "Capsaicin is the compound responsible for the irritant effects of capsicum . Perceived heat from capsaicin when ingesting cayenne is caused by activation of transient receptor potential vanilloid subfamily member 1 (TRPV1), located in neurons on the tongue . Capsinoids lack this sensory quality because they are hydrolyzed as they cross the oral mucosa . Potential thermogenic effects also involve activation of TRPV1 receptors on vagal afferents in the gut . Capsaicin may induce energy expenditure by enhancing core body and skin temperature and influencing substrate oxidation, but these effects can vary with body composition . It was also found to induce coronary vasodilation by releasing calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), a potent vasodilator. Depletion in CGRP leads to a subsequent increase in blood pressure . Interactions between capsaicin and cyclosporin indicate the ability of capsaicin to modulate P-gp and CYP3A gene expression and to also increase cyclosporin bioavailability via CYP3A inhibition . Lignan glycosides isolated from capsicum pepper were also shown to have strong scavenging activity against the free radical, DPPH In vitro and animal studies indicate capsaicin causes cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in both ER+ and ER− breast cancer cells by modulating the EGFR/HER-2 pathway . Orally administered capsaicin also slowed the growth of PC-3 prostate cancer cells in mice by downregulating expression of androgen receptors and by a direct inhibitory effect on prostate specific antigen transcription . In bladder cancer, capsaicin mediates cell death through reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and mitochondrial depolarization . Conversely, in certain concentrations, capsaicin may promote colorectal cancer metastasis by triggering ROS production and modulating Akt/mTOR and STAT-3 pathways ",
      "Contraindications": "Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding, as there have been case reports of dermatitis in nursing infants ",

In animal models, chronic high-dose capsaicin use increased cyclosporin bioavailability P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrates: Capsaicin may alter drug absorption and metabolism Theophylline: Animal models indicate that concurrent capsaicin administration may increase absorption Oral co-administration of other drugs: Capsaicin causes mucosal vasodilation, thereby altering the uptake of other drugs ",

      "Clinical Summary": "Cesium is an alkali metal that is stable in its natural form. The radioactive isoform (Cesium 137) is used in radiation therapy. Cesium chloride, the non-radioactive salt, is promoted as an alternative treatment, also known as “high pH therapy,” for cancer. This is based on the findings that cancer cells have an affinity for cesium ions . Proponents claim that the increased cellular pH following uptake of cesium prevents cancer cells from undergoing mitosis and neutralizes the toxic material present in them. But there are no data to substantiate these claims. According to a case series report, half of the patients with terminal cancers who used a cesium-based regimen survived after one year. However, one quarter of the patients died in the first two weeks which suggests that the treatment is highly toxic \nReported adverse effects of cesium chloride intake include syncope, hypokalemia, diarrhea, and ventricular tachycardia with prolonged QT interval .  No randomized clinical trials have been conducted using oral cesium chloride as a cancer treatment.",
      "Purported Uses2": [
        "Cancer treatment"
      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "Proponents of cesium chloride therapy claim that it exerts antitumor effects by increasing the intracellular pH of tumor cells. The resulting alkaline environment is thought to prevent cancer cells from undergoing mitosis and eventually result in cell death.  Cesium causes hypokalemia by inhibiting potassium channels used for absorption of dietary potassium or for reabsorption of renal potassium. It may also cause hypokalemia indirectly via loss of potassium due to repetitive diarrhea . Intravenous administration of cesium has been shown to cause arrhythmias in animals ",

      "Clinical Summary": "Chaga mushroom is found on birch and other trees in cold climates. It has been used as a folk remedy for cancer, digestive system diseases, and various ailments in Russia and other northern European countries. The conk that is used medicinally comprises wood from the substrate tree and mycelium of the invasive fungus In vitro, chaga has demonstrated antitumor , anti-mutagenic , antiviral , antiplatelet , antidiabetic , and analgesic  effects. In vivo studies also demonstrate immunomodulating , anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving properties In animal studies, chaga displayed anti-allergic , cognition-enhancing, and antioxidant activities . In murine colitis models, chaga exerted anti-inflammatory effects . Oral administration of polysaccharides from chaga increased exercise endurance and biological measures related to fatigue . Hypoglycemic effects in mice with diabetes mellitus were observed with administration of artificially-cultivated chaga Extracts and constituents of chaga have inhibitory and proapoptotic effects against colon cancer  and hepatoma  cells. Inotodiol from chaga exerted antitumor effects against cervical cancer cells . In some studies, chaga demonstrated selective apoptosis in tumor cells with no effects on healthy cells . It also reduced toxicity associated with radiation  and inhibited melanoma cell growth in animal models An extract of chaga reduced oxidative stress in lymphocytes from patients with inflammatory bowel disease . No clinical trials have been conducted to assess chaga’s safety and efficacy for disease prevention or for the treatment of cancer, cardiovascular disease, or diabetes.In vitro studies suggest that constituents of chaga mushroom extract may interact with anticoagulant  and antidiabetic drugs . Chaga mushrooms are very high in oxalates and excessive intake may have toxic effects Because natural reserves of this fungus have nearly been exhausted, scientists are seeking to develop cultivated substitutes of wild chaga ",
      "Food Sources": "Although chaga is an edible fungus, it is not commonly ingested due to its bitter nature. Tea can be made from the whole mushroom.",

        "Immunostimulation"
      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "Oxalic, gallic, protocatechuic and p-hydroxybenzoic acids have been identified in chaga extracts . In vitro, antidiabetic effects are attributed to terpenoids that inhibit alpha-glucosidase . Anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving properties may occur via inhibition of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) . Immunomodulating effects are attributed to Th1/Th2 cytokine secretion in immune cells and regulation of antigen-specific antibody production . Anti-quorum sensing activity in chaga conks suggests broader anti-infection attributes beyond immunomodulatory effects In animal studies, a methanolic extract of chaga produced beneficial effects on learning and memory via decreased malondialdehyde and nitrite levels, decreased acetylcholinesterase activity, and restored glutathione, superoxide dismutase, and acetylcholine levels . Antifatigue effects were attributed to polysaccharides from chaga, which increased endurance and glycogen content of liver and muscle in mice, while decreasing blood lactic acid and serum urea nitrogen levels . Anti-inflammatory effects in animal colitis models were related to suppression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, iNOS, and interleukin (IL)-1beta 3beta-hydroxy-lanosta-8, 24-dien-21-al, and inotodiol constituents in chaga produce antimutagenic and antioxidative activities . Water-soluble lignin derivatives have also been identified as bioactive constituents with anticancer properties . A hot-water extract of chaga exhibited inhibitory and proapoptotic actions against colon cancer cells via upregulation of Bax and caspase-3 and downregulation of Bcl-2 . Inhibition of colorectal cancer was exerted by the constituent ergosterol via downregulation of the beta-catenin pathway . Inotodiol, a triterpenoid isolated from chaga, inhibited proliferation of cervical cancer cells and induced apoptosis in vitro via increased Bax expression, decreased Bcl-2, cyclin E downregulation, and p27 up-regulation . Aqueous extracts of chaga inhibited growth of human hepatoma cells via G0/G1 phase cell-cycle arrest and selective apoptotic induction . This selective activation may result from pH changes in the tumor microenvironment . Other apoptotic characteristics can induce caspase cleavage and nuclear fragmentation . Like many medicinal mushrooms, beta glucans in chaga exert immunomodulating activities, binding to complement receptor 3 so that immune cells recognize cancer cells as “non-self” ",
      "Adverse Reactions": "As there have been no clinical trials to assess chaga’s safety, there is a lack of information with respect to potential side effects.Case report Oxalate nephropathy: In a 72-year-old Japanese woman with liver cancer, caused by the ingestion of chaga mushroom powder 4-5 tsps daily for 6 months ",

      "How It Works": "Chamomile may benefit those with anxiety disorder and insomnia. It has not been shown to treat or prevent cancer.Several studies have used chamomile extracts in animals to test their effects. They show that substances in chamomile can kill bacteria, reduce inflammation, calm muscle spasms, inhibit the growth of polio and herpes viruses and cancer cells, and prevent the growth of ulcers. Several chemicals found in chamomile leaves are known to inhibit substances in the body that cause an inflammatory response. Apigenin, a compound isolated from chamomile, binds to brain cells in the same areas as well-known depressant drugs, which could explain chamomile’s sedative effects. Small clinical trials show that chamomile may have a modest effect on generalized anxiety disorder, insomnia, and in healing skin lesions after colostomy, a surgical procedure that brings one end of the large intestine out through the abdominal wall.",

      "Scientific Name": "Matricaria recutita, Chamomilla recutita, Matricaria chamomilla",
      "Clinical Summary": "Chamomile, an aromatic annual herb, has a long history of use in traditional medicine to treat muscle spasms, menstrual disorders, insomnia, ulcers, wounds, stomach disorders, rheumatic pain, hay fever, and hemorrhoids. It is widely used in teas for its relaxing and calming effects. In vitro and animal studies indicate that chamomile extracts have anti-inflammatory , anti-hyperglycemic , antigenotoxic  and anticancer  properties. Apigenin, a flavone present in chamomile, has strong chemopreventive effects . Bisabololoxide A, another constituent, was shown to reduce the dose of 5-fluorouracil when used together against leukemic cells \nClinical data suggest modest benefits of oral chamomile in improving chronic insomnia , and chamomile tea was shown to have positive effects on glycemic control in patients with diabetes . Multiple studies have reported that chamomile extracts are effective against mild-to-moderate  and moderate-to-severe generalized anxiety disorder , and may have antidepressant effects as well Data also show that chamomile can improve the cortisol slope, a biological marker of chronic stress, in people with chronic anxiety  In another controlled trial, application of a chamomile compress was shown to be effective, and superior, to hydrocortisone ointment, in facilitating healing of peristomal skin lesions in patients following colostomy \nA chamomile mouthwash was found to reduce 5-fluorouracil-induced mucositis in hamsters , but data from human studies are conflicting . More research is warranted.",
      "Purported Uses2": [
        "Anxiety",

        "Inflammation",
        "Insomnia",
        "Mucositis"
      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "The anti-inflammatory activity of chamomile involves the release of LPS-induced prostaglandin E(2) in RAW 264.7 macrophages via inhibition of COX-2 enzyme activity . Methanol extracts of chamomile exert anti-allergic effects by inhibiting histamine release from mast cells . They also showed neuroprotective activity by decreasing lipid peroxidation (LPO) and increasing superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione (GSH), and total thiol levels \nTopical chamomile has been shown to reduce the tissue levels of IL-1β and TNF-α in hamsters with oral mucositis . In another study, a chamomile extract was shown to afford gastroprotection against ethanol-induced ulceration by increasing glutathione levels . Apigenin, a flavone component of chamomile, interacts with GABA (A) (gamma-aminobutyric acid)-benzodiazepine receptors in vitro and inhibits locomotor behavior in rats . Apigenin was also shown to affect alternative splicing of key mRNAs by inhibiting dimerization of hnRNPA2, a factor associated with many cellular malignancies and in mRNA metabolism and splicing ",
      "Contraindications": "Individuals allergic to ragweed or members of the Compositae family, such as chrysanthemums, should avoid this product.",
      "Adverse Reactions": "Hypersensitivity reactions including asthma, contact dermatitis, and anaphylaxis can occur following exposure to chamomile Case reportsPremature constriction of fetal ductus arteriosus: Following consumption of chamomile tea by the mother during pregnancy Severe anaphylaxis with generalized urticaria, angioedema, and severe dyspnea: In a 38-year-old Caucasian man, 1 hour after consuming chamomile tea. Symptoms improved following treatment with an intravenous antihistamine Multiple internal hemorrhages: In a 70-year-old woman following concurrent use of chamomile products and warfarin. Her symptoms resolved after treatment with intravenous heparin Occupational allergic rhinoconjunctivitis: From the inhalation of chamomile dried flowers Increased lactogenesis and breast tension: In a lactating woman, a few hours after consuming chamomile ",
      "Herb-Drug Interactions": "Anticoagulants / Antiplatelets: Chamomile may increase the anticoagulant effects and inhibit platelet activity due to its coumarin content Sedatives: Chamomile may increase the effects of sedatives  Cytochrome P450 substrates: Chamomile inhibits CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, and can affect the intracellular concentration of drugs metabolized by these enzymes Cyclosporine: Concurrent use resulted in increased serum levels of cyclosporine ",

      "How It Works": "There is evidence to suggest that chasteberry helps improve symptoms associated with premenstrual syndrome.\nChasteberry is used widely to treat infertility and for relief of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) symptoms. Laboratory analysis has shown that chasteberry contains hormonal precursors that can prompt hormone changes within the body by activating those receptors. Various studies have found chasteberry to be effective in reducing breast pain and other PMS symptoms, but not for symptoms of menopause.Because of its ability to influence hormone levels in the body, chasteberry should be avoided by patients with hormone-sensitive diseases including certain types of cancers.",
      "Purported Uses": [
        [
          "To ease difficult and painful menstruation",
          "A handful of clinical trials support this use in women aged 20–40 whose ovarian function was not greatly impaired and who had no other hormone imbalances."

          "There is no evidence to support this claim. One study that evaluated chasteberry in combination with St. John’s wort did not find it effective for menopausal symptoms. Because chasteberry contains sex hormones like progesterone, it is not known whether it would be a safe alternative to hormone replacement therapy."

      "Side Effects": "Reported:  Nausea, headache, gastrointestinal disturbances, menstrual disorders, acne, itching, redness/rash",
      "Scientific Name": "Vitex agnus castus",
      "Clinical Summary": "The fruit of chasteberry is widely used to relieve symptoms associated with premenstrual syndrome and to treat infertility. It is said to have a normalizing action on the menstrual cycle and contains non-steroidal progestins that can interact with and activate hormone receptors in the body Chasteberry has opioidergic , dopaminergic , hepatoprotective , and antiproliferative  properties in vitro. Clinical studies suggest its efficacy in reducing symptoms associated with PMS , and for the treatment of mastalgia . However, in combination with St. John’s wort, chasteberry was not found effective for treating menopausal symptoms Chasteberry influences hormonal activities  and should be avoided by patients with hormone-sensitive diseases.",
      "Purported Uses2": [
        "Dysmenorrhea",
        "Mastalgia",
        "Menopausal symptoms"
      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "In vitro studies have identified several flavonoids in chasteberry, especially casticin, which exert opioidergic effects through the activation of mu- and delta-opioid receptor subtypes (MOR and DOR respectively) . Dopaminergic compounds, particularly clerodadienols, dose-dependently inhibit pituitary prolactin release, which could explain its effect during the premenstrual cycle when serum prolactin levels can be chronically elevated . Other diterpenes including rotundifuran also modulate dopamine (d2) receptors . Linoleic acid from chasteberry binds to estrogen receptors (ER) and can induce certain estrogen genes . The flavonoid apigenin was identified as the most active ER isoform-selective phytoestrogen , and can also induce progestogenic activity In human studies, chasteberry restores progesterone concentrations, prolongs the hyperthermic phase in the basal temperature curve, and restores the luteinizing hormone (LH)-releasing hormone (LHRH) test to normal. It is thought to act on the pituitary-hypothalamic axis rather than directly on the ovaries ",
      "Contraindications": [
        [
          "Chasteberry may have estrogenic",
          "and progestogenic",

        ],
        "Chasteberry should also be avoided during pregnancy and lactation"
      ],
      "Adverse Reactions": "Reported: The most frequent adverse events are nausea, headache, gastrointestinal disturbances, menstrual disorders, acne, pruritus and erythematous rash ",
      "Herb-Drug Interactions": "Antipsychotics (Phenothiazines, Dopamine D2-Antagonists): Chasteberry may interfere with the action of these drugs or enhance their side effects Antiparkinson agents (Dopamine agonists): Chasteberry may interfere with the action of these drugs or enhance their side effects Cytochrome P450 substrates: Chasteberry inhibits CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 and may affect drugs metabolized by these enzymes Hormonal therapies: Chasteberry may decrease the effects of hormone therapies Oral contraceptives: Chasteberry may decrease the effects of contraceptives ",

      "Scientific Name": "Salvia hispanica",
      "Clinical Summary": "The chia plant is native to Central and South America and the seeds it produces have been consumed as food since ancient times. They are high in dietary fiber, n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), and alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), and are marketed as dietary supplements for cardiovascular health and weight loss. The seeds can expand and turn into a gel-like substance when mixed with water, and are often found in a variety of packaged goods touted as functional foods or superfoods.Various laboratory analyses suggest that chia constituents have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and antithrombotic activities . In obese rodents, chia seeds were shown to prevent the onset of dyslipidemia  , reverse insulin resistance , and confer cardio- and hepatoprotective effects  , but chia seed or oil did not reduce body weight gain or abdominal fat accumulation In clinical studies, chia did not benefit overweight adults  , or had only modest effects , but it may help patients with type 2 diabetes  . Other small studies suggest chia supplementation may prolong satiety and has positive effects on blood glucose levels . Chia flour supplementation was found to reduce blood pressure in both treated and untreated hypertensive subjects . However, a systematic review determined that most studies of chia’s effects on cardiovascular disease risk factors did not demonstrate statistically significant results . In other small studies, topical use of chia seed oil was helpful for pruritus in a small group of patients with end-stage renal disease , and consumption of chia oil during pregnancy and nursing transiently increased docosahexaenoic acid in breast milk Oil from chia seeds has demonstrated anticancer properties in mice  , but human studies have not been conducted. More research is needed to elucidate and validate health benefits with chia supplementation. Rare adverse or allergic reactions have been reported.",

      "Mechanism of Action": "Active compounds in chia include essential fatty acids, flavonols, and phenolic compounds, some of which have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and antithrombotic activities . Protein content of chia is higher than that of most traditional grains . The main protein fractions extracted from chia seed flour were globulins, with globulin peptides demonstrating homology to sesame proteins, and essential amino acids, especially methionine and cysteine In animal models, chia seed reversed impaired insulin stimulated glycogen synthase activity, glycogen, glucose-6-phosphate and GLUT-4 protein levels as well as insulin resistance and dyslipidemia Decreases in postprandial glycemia with chia supplementation seen in generally healthy human volunteers may explain the improvements in blood pressure, coagulation, and inflammatory markers observed in patients with type II diabetes IgE-mediated anaphylaxis by chia seeds appeared to be caused by water- and lipo-soluble allergens including a lectin, an elongation factor, and an 11S globulin ",
      "Warnings": "Never consume dry chia seeds on their own, as they can absorb up to 27 times their weight in water. This may cause them to expand and become lodged in the esophagus. Chia seeds should be prepared or mixed with sufficient amounts of liquid to allow them to expand before consumption ",
      "Contraindications": "Patients with any history of swallowing problems should use chia seeds with caution due to absorption interactions with liquid, causing them to expand ",
      "Adverse Reactions": "Case reports Blocked esophagus: In a 39-year-old man who received emergency treatment to remove chia seeds from the esophagus. The cause of the blockage was the ingestion of no more than 1 tablespoon of dry chia seeds followed by a glass of water Anaphylactic reaction: In a 54-year-old man with previous diagnosis of rhinitis and asthma, after a few days of consuming chia seeds to lower cholesterol levels.

    "details": {
      "How It Works": "Although Chinese asparagus has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for centuries, evidence of its effectiveness against cancer, hepatitis, or any other disease is lacking.Scientists are not sure how Chinese asparagus works, since little research has been performed on this botanical. In the laboratory setting, Chinese asparagus extracts slowed the growth of isolated lung cancer cells, and protected liver cells from alcohol toxicity. However, it is not known whether these effects occur in the human body, and more research is needed to evaluate its safety and effectiveness.",
      "Purported Uses": [
        [
          "To treat cancer",
          "Limited laboratory research shows some activity against isolated lung cancer cell lines. Human data are needed."
        ],
        [
          "To treat lung diseases",
          "Preliminary laboratory studies suggest that compounds found in Chinese asparagus may protect against airway inflammatory diseases, but no human studies have been conducted."
        ],
        [
          "To treat hepatitis",
          "Limited laboratory research shows a protective effect against alcohol toxicity in isolated liver cells. Human studies have not been conducted."
        ]
      ],
      "Do Not Take If": "You are taking cytochrome P450 substrate drugs: Animal studies suggest that Chinese asparagus may affect how certain drugs are metabolized by these enzymes or increase the risk of side effects.",
      "Scientific Name": "Asparagus cochinchinensis",
      "Clinical Summary": "Derived from the root of the plant, Chinese asparagus is used in traditional Chinese medicine as a tonic and to treat a variety of conditions including breast cancer, liver disease, and airway inflammatory diseases In vitro studies indicate that it has anti-inflammatory effects , and can prevent ethanol-induced cytotoxicity . The root extract was shown to slow aging in mice via antioxidant effects In lung cancer cells, aspacochioside C isolated from A. cochinchinensis showed moderate cytotoxicity , and the compound methylprotodioscin downregulated proinflammatory cytokine production . However, Chinese asparagus or these constituents have not been studied in humans as a treatment for cancer.In animal studies, Chinese asparagus induced CYP2E1 and CYP1A2 activities, suggesting potential interactions with drugs metabolized by these enzymes ",
      "Purported Uses2": [
        "Cancer treatment",
        "Health maintenance",
        "Lung diseases",
        "Hepatitis"
      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "Compounds isolated from this species include norlignans , steroidal saponins , pregnane glycosides, aspacochinosides, and furostanol glycosides, some of which may have anti-neuroinflammatory effects in lipopolysaccharide-induced murine microglial cells via inhibition of nitric oxide (NO) production . An aqueous extract of asparagus root inhibits tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha secretion in mouse astrocytes . Asparagus root also reduces alcohol-induced hepatotoxicity in Hep G2 cell lines In vitro and murine models of lung inflammation suggest that methylprotodioscin is the active constituent that protects against airway inflammation . Dioscin and methylprotodioscin suppressed airway mucin gene expression and production by acting directly on airway epithelial cells . Methylprotodioscin inhibited production of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, TNF-alpha, and IL-1beta in lung tissue , and downregulated proinflammatory cytokine production via c-Jun N-terminal kinase/c-Jun pathway inhibition in lung cancer cells ",
      "Herb-Drug Interactions": "Cytochrome P450 substrates: In animal studies, Chinese asparagus was shown to induce the activities of CYP2E1 and CYP1A2, suggesting potential interactions with drugs metabolized by these enzymes ",

    "details": {
      "How It Works": "D-limonene has not been shown to treat or prevent cancer.\nD-limonene is derived from the peels of citrus fruits. It showed anti-inflammatory, wound healing and anticancer effects in laboratory studies. D-limonene was shown to alter the signaling pathways within cancer cells in a way that stops cancer cells from multiplying and causes their death (this is called “apoptosis”). In animal models, D-limonene slowed the growth of pancreatic, stomach, colon, skin, and liver cancers. It also slowed formation of tumors and their progression in animals exposed to cancer-causing substances. However, these anticancer effects have not been shown in humans.",
      "Purported Uses": [
        [
          "To prevent and treat cancer",

      "Clinical Summary": "Derived from the peels of citrus fruits, D-limonene is a terpene used to prevent and treat cancer and is also promoted as a treatment for gastroesophageal reflux.In vitro and animal studies suggest that D-limonene has anti-inflammatory , bactericidal , wound healing  and anticancer effects . It was also shown to enhance the activity of docetaxel against prostate cancer cells . An epidemiological study reported an inverse relationship between citrus peel consumption and squamous cell carcinoma , but an early clinical trial in breast cancer patients failed to support the observations . Further research is necessary to determine if D-limonene has a role in the prevention or treatment of cancer.",

        "Cancer prevention",
        "Cancer treatment",
        "Heartburn and GERD (gastroesophageal reflux)"
      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "D-Limonene and its metabolites, perillic acid, dihydroperillic acid, uroterpenol, and limonene1,2-diol, may inhibit tumor growth via inhibition of p21-dependent signaling and apoptosis resulting from induction of the transforming growth factor beta-signaling pathway . D-Limonene metabolites also cause G1 cell cycle arrest, inhibit post-translational modification of signal transduction proteins, and cause differential expression of cell cycle- and apoptosis-related genes D-limonene induces apoptosis via the mitochondrial death pathway and suppression of the PI3K/Akt pathway in human colon cancer cells . Animal studies show activity of D-limonene against pancreatic, stomach, colon, skin, and liver cancers . Data also indicate that D-limonene slows the promotion/progression stage of carcinogen-induced tumors in rats . The chemopreventive activity of D-limonene may be via inhibition of inflammation, oxidative stress and Ras-signaling as well as the induction of pro-apoptotic state in a mouse model of skin tumorigenesis D-limonene and its metabolite perillyl alcohol were shown to affect wound healing by decreasing systemic cytokine production, and by inhibiting endothelial P-selectin expression and neo-vascularization ",

      "Clinical Summary": "Dandelion is related to the daisy family and commonly found worldwide. The flower, leaf and root of this plant are used in traditional medicine for their diuretic, cholagogic, antirheumatic and appetite-stimulating properties . In Chinese Medicine, the herb has been used to promote lactation and reduce abscesses especially in the breast and intestines In vitro and in vivo studies suggest that dandelion has lipid-lowering , hepatoprotective , and antiviral  properties. It also has anticoagulant , diuretic , anti-inflammatory , and antioxidant  activities. Dandelion root extract has anticancer effects against melanoma , leukemia , pancreatic cancer , and colorectal cancer  cell lines. However, human studies are limited.Dandelion has estrogenic activity. It may increase the proliferation of hormone-sensitive breast cancer cells . It can also cause allergic reactions and may interact with some prescription drugs.",

        "Lactation stimulation",
        "Liver disease",
        "Promote urination"
      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "The diuretic activity of dandelion may be a result of its high potassium content . In murine models of diet-induced fatty liver disease, dandelion leaf extract exihibited hepatoprotective effects with decreased serum levels of ALT, hepatic TG, and MDA, as well as TNF-alpha and IL-6 expression . At the post-transcriptional level, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties were exihibited via decreased activation of procaspase-3 to active caspase-3, and JNK phosphorylation . Linoleic acid, phytol and tetracosanol have been identified as bioactive compounds, with hypolipidemic effects occurring via AMP-activated protein kinase activation in human HepG2 cells Dandelion has been shown to decrease human hepatoma cell line viability by increasing tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1alpha production . Other research has shown that the presence of luteolin and luteolin 7-glucoside in dandelion flower extract exhibits cytotoxic activities against the colon adenocarcinoma cell line (Caco-2) . An isolated compound identical to lupeol, a lupane-type triterpene, inhibited cell growth and induced melanogenesis in a mouse melanoma cell line . Taraxinic acid, derived from dandelion, induced differentiation in a promyelocytic leukemia cell line Sesquiterpene lactones are thought to be the allergenic compounds in dandelion ",
      "Adverse Reactions": "Oral: Heartburn, stomach inflammation, dyspepsia; mild diarrhea with overdosage ; hypoglycemia Contact dermatitis: Can be more common in children from exposure to dandelion Case reportsHemorrhagic cystitis: In a 33-year-old woman following use of a slimming product containing dandelion. Symptoms resolved after product discontinuation Toxic blood levels of immunosuppressive agents: In a kidney transplant recipient, that occurred after consumption of a tea that contained dandelion, which inhibits CYP3A4 used in the metabolism of these drugs Digital necrosis: In a 56-year-old man with chronic kidney disease, cutaneous manifestations of hyperoxaluria related to high intake of dandelion tea (10–15 cups daily for 6 months) Contact dermatitis: In a 7-year-old boy, which improved by avoidance of handling plants ",

      "Clinical Summary": "The most abundant hormone secreted by the adrenal glands, DHEA circulates in the blood as the sulfate ester, dehydroepiandrosterone-3-sulfate (DHEA-S). Both are precursors for other hormones, including estrogen and androgens . Animal studies indicate that DHEA may have chemopreventive effects , blocks the development of tumors , and enhances immune response following hepatitis  and influenza  vaccinations. Although it has been postulated that DHEA may play a role in increasing immune response in acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) , no antiviral or immunostimulatory effects were observed in HIV-positive participants receiving DHEA \nIn clinical trials, DHEA was shown effective in treating Addison’s disease , major depression , schizophrenia-induced anxiety , systematic lupus erythematosus , osteoporosis , and erectile dysfunction . Topical application of DHEA in postmenopausal women resulted in increased sebum production and epidermal thickening in the hands and face . However, other studies did not find effectivess of DHEA in treating Alzheimer’s disease , obesity in adolescents , or perimenopausal symptoms . Furthermore, DHEA does not increase muscle mass  or physical performance , enhance insulin secretion or action , or improve cognitive performance  in elderly individuals.  DHEA supplementation, believed to enhance physical strength, did not improve physical performance or quality of life in a study done in older men and women . However conflicting data suggest improvements in cognitive  and physical function  in older women. DHEA has been used to treat sexual dysfunction in postmenopausal women. But results from clinical studies are mixed . Whether DHEA is effective for treating adrenal insufficiency is not clear \nDHEA alters some of the activities of the cytochrome P-450 enzyme that metabolizes several drugs . In premenopausal women, high levels of DHEA have been associated with increased risk of ovarian  and breast  cancers. High DHEA-S levels have also been shown to contribute to tamoxifen resistance and disease progression in breast cancer . A case of cancer flare-up was reported in a patient with advanced prostate cancer undergoing DHEA treatment ",

      "Mechanism of Action": "DHEA is an endogenous hormone secreted by the adrenal cortex in response to adrenocorticotropin. DHEA is metabolized into androstenedione in the body and may be further converted into either testosterone or estrogen. Low levels of endogenous DHEA have been associated with the following disease states: burn trauma, coronary artery disease, non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, obsessive-compulsive disorder, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus . Endogenous DHEA concentration peaks around 20 years of age and declines with age.\nDHEA has been shown to stimulate insulin growth factor-1 . G6PD is necessary for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) production. DHEA has also been shown to increase levels of interleukin-2 in animal models . DHEA reduces the effects of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6, which are thought to reduce flares in systemic lupus erythematosus . Numerous studies have reported an inverse relationship between DHEA concentration and cardiovascular disease . DHEA administration improved mental function scores in patients with advanced HIV infection , enhanced influenza vaccination in elderly patients , and decreased oxidative stress markers in patients with type II diabetes in part by negatively influencing TNF-alpha signaling . Although DHEA-S concentration does not appear to be correlated with cognitive decline in aging men , the anti-depressive effects of DHEA may be mediated by GABAA receptor modulation . DHEA has also been shown to affect cytochrome P-450 enzymes in the liver . The exact effect that this will have on other drugs remains unclear.\nAnalogs of DHEA that cannot be converted to androgens and estrogens have been developed and have demonstrated anti-proliferative effects . DHEA inhibits glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) in vitro and blocks the development of tumors in mice . It was also shown to induce authophagic cell death in human hepatoma cells via a mitogen activated protein kinase (JNK)-transciption factor (Nrf2)-protein complex p62 axis .But an increase in concentration of sex hormones including DHEA has been shown to increase the risk of breast cancer . And prolonged intake of DHEA in postmenopausal women may increase the risk of breast cancer particularly in obese subjects . The sulfate ester DHEA-S also stimulates estrogen receptor-positive cell growth ",

It was shown to inhibit the production of inflammatory cytokines including interleukins IL-1beta, IL-6, and tumor-necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) in mouse macrophage cells . A devil’s claw extract also demonstrated anti-inflammatory activity via inhibiting the induction of pro-inflammatory gene expression, possibly by blocking the activator protein (AP-1, a transcription factor) pathway Harpagide may also prevent bone loss by regulating the stimulation of osteoblast differentiation and the suppression of osteoclast formation in  mice . In another study, it was shown to block lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced bone loss in a model of inflammatory osteoporosis. However, harpagide was not effective in preventing bone loss mediated by ovariectomy in postmenopausal osteoporosis Investigations of the mechanisms underlying the pain-releiving activity of devil’s claw showed involvement of the heme oxygenase-1/carbon monoxide (plays a role in nociceptive processing) system in carrageenan-induced inflammatory pain . Devil’s claw  exerts antioxidant effects by scavenging both superoxide and peroxyl in a dose dependent manner Beta-sitosterol, a sterol found in devil’s claw, has anticancer properties but the mechanism of action is unknown ",

      "Clinical Summary": "Di Bella multitherapy, a questionable alternative therapy, consists of somatostatin, melatonin, bromocriptine, a solution of retinoids, and low doses of cyclophosphamide or hydroxyurea. Physiologist Luigi Di Bella developed the regimen and promotes it as an effective treatment for cancer, retinitis pigmentosa, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Alzheimer’s disease. Treatment is tailored to the individual patient, and purportedly stimulates the body’s self-healing without the toxicity of conventional chemotherapy.\nDi Bella multitherapy is based on the theory that growth hormone (GH) and prolactin are involved in neoplastic growth. Somatostatin and its analog octreotide inhibit the secretion of GH and IGF-1 in humans , while bromocriptine is a prolactin inhibitor . This treatment was very popular in Italy in the late 1990s as Di Bella claimed he cured thousands on an outpatient basis and physicians in other countries, such as Canada, also prescribed it. The treatment was also highly publicized and politicized in Italy, raising the issue of “freedom of treatment” for patients who could not afford the expensive regimen. In response, local judges ordered that somatostatin be added to the list of effective reimbursable medications , and the Italian National Institute of Health supported 11 separate open-label uncontrolled phase II studies of 8 different cancers, organized by Di Bella and the National Cancer Advisory Committee . These trials found no complete responses , 0.8% partial response rate, and considerable toxicity . However, an uncontrolled study of 20 patients with late stage non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma had a 70% response rate with a similar regimen Adverse effects include increased pain at tumor site, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, diarrhea, and somnolence . Somatostatin may reduce or eliminate the efficacy of painkillers (e.g., methadone, morphine) ",

      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "The Di Bella Multitherapy is based on the theory that growth hormone (GH) and prolactin are involved in neoplastic growth, particularly in lymphomas and leukemias. The following components have been studied, but their combined activities and at the Di Bella doses are unknown.\nSomatostatin inhibits growth hormone (GH) secretion. Its synthetic analog, octreotide, shows antineoplastic activity in vitro and in vivo, and is used clinically for the treatment of acromegaly and neuroendocrine tumors. Their biological effects are mediated via high affinity plasma membrane receptors that are found throughout the body and on many human tumors. Clinical studies show a reduction in serum IGF-1 and IGF-1 gene expression after treatment with octreotide . Somatostatin and analogs also enhance secretion and expression of IGF-binding protein-1, which negatively regulates plasma IGF-1, while inhibiting mitogens and secretion of gastrointestinal hormones implicated in tumor growth. Somatostatin analogs also show immune-modulating activity in vitro and inhibit angiogenesis and directly induce cell growth arrest and apoptosis in vivo and in vitro Melatonin is a free-radical scavenger and displays anti-proliferative effects on various cancer cell lines in vitro, but no human studies show evidence of anti-tumor activity. Melatonin shows antimyelodysplastic activity and reduces bone marrow toxicity of chemotherapeutic agents in animal models. See melatonin for additional information Bromocriptine is a dopamine agonist and prolactin inhibitor.

      "Clinical Summary": "Dimethylglycine (DMG) is a derivative of the amino acid glycine. It is found naturally in plant and animal cells and in certain foods such as beans, cereal grains, and liver. DMG is produced in cells during the metabolism of choline  and is considered an antioxidant and enhancer of oxygenation at the cellular level . It has been found that choline and DMG are present at higher levels in fetal than in maternal plasma, suggesting that choline provides glycine via DMG for glutathione synthesis in fetal development . Plasma DMG levels have also been found to be lower in children with cystic fibrosis than in healthy children . DMG has purported use in enhancement of the immune system, stimulation of neurological functions, management of autism and epilepsy . Some studies have shown that DMG may help enhance both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses in humans and animals , enhance oxygen utilization during hypoxia, reduce lactic acid build-up in the blood during stressful events, and the number of seizures . However, conflicting data suggest that DMG has no effect on either specific or nonspecific immunity . DMG was also found to have no effect on oxygen consumption (VO2) in children with SLSJ-COX deficiency . The use of DMG to treat seizures or autism also stays controversial as clinical trials have yielded mixed results . DMG is non-toxic  and no significant adverse effects have been reported. DMG should not be confused with trimethylglycine (TMG), also know as betaine, that is involved in the methylation of homocysteine to form methionine.",

        "Chronic fatigue syndrome"
      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "DMG supplementation has been used to enhance physical performance in animals perhaps via improved oxygen utilization and reduced lactic acid formation, but clinical studies are lacking. In humans it is thought to enhance humoral and cell-mediated immune responses . Purported uses for DMG include autism, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, epilepsy, chronic fatigue syndrome, and athletic performance enhancement; however, no mechanisms of action have been uncovered to elucidate such claims. A recent metabolic analysis of healthy subjects correlated high plasma cholesterol levels with low levels for some metabolites related to mitochondrial metabolism including dimethylglycine . DMG has been used as an ester to increase the solubility and bioavailability of a prodrug used in cancer research . However, DMG is not the active moiety and there is no evidence it has any antitumor effects.",

      "Clinical Summary": "Dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) is a widely used chemical solvent because of its high polarity. It is also used in the laboratories as a cryopreservative. DMSO is readily absorbed by the skin and has been studied as a vehicle for topical drugs. It is thought to have analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties and has been used topically to relieve pain and to treat arthritis.\nSmall scale studies conducted in the early 1980s suggested that DMSO may help relieve peripheral neuropathy  and post-thoracotomy pain . But a systematic review of DMSO reported a lack of definitive evidence against osteoarthritis  and painful bladder syndrome/interstitial cystitis \nDMSO has been used to prevent or treat extravasations of chemotherapeutic agents . It may also slow down the progression of cancer cells; however, data are inconsistent \nDMSO has been shown to cause neural damage in animals . Topical application results in a strong garlic taste in the mouth . Intravesical DMSO is an approved prescription drug for the treatment of interstitial cystitis. DMSO is not approved for use in other forms due to lack of efficacy and safety data.",

        "Pain",
        "Rheumatoid arthritis",
        "Sedation"
      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "DMSO is diluted on exposure to air. Upon topical application, it rapidly penetrates the skin; however, unlike most penetrating solvents, it is not associated with irreversible membrane damage. DMSO can enhance the skin penetration of other drugs. Analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects may benefit patients with rheumatoid arthritis . In addition, DMSO traps free radical hydroxide; its antioxidant properties are thought to be responsible for the prevention of chemotherapy extravasations . A strong garlic taste in the mouth following DMSO administration is due to the exhaled dimethylsulfide (DMS) metabolite ",
      "Warnings": "DMSO is an approved prescription drug for the treatment of interstitial cystitis intravesically only. It is not approved for over-the-counter use in any form due to inadequate evidence of efficacy and potential toxicities. The industrial form of DMSO may be contaminated with other chemicals.",
      "Contraindications": "Pregnant women should avoid DMSO ",
      "Adverse Reactions": "Reported: Garlic taste in mouth, dry skin, erythema and pruritis , urine discoloration, halitosis, agitation, hypotension, sedation dizziness . Changes in eye lens have been reported in animals following administration of DMSO ",

      "Clinical Summary": "Dong quai is an herb the root of which has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for thousands of years. It is often combined with other herbs in formulations. Dong quai is also available as a dietary supplement and promoted as a woman’s herb to treat menstrual and menopausal symptoms. Extracts of dong quai demonstrated antitumor , pro-apoptotic , anti-metastatic , anti-tuberculosis (TB) , neuroprotective , and hematopoeitic  effects in vitro. In animal studies, the polysaccharides extracted from dong quai root showed protective effects against cyclophosphamide-induced toxicity , doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity , and radiation-induced pneumonitis . But these effects have not been evaluated in humans.Data from an epidemiologic study suggest an inverse association of dong quai consumption with reduced risk of subsequent endometrial cancer in breast cancer survivors . Clinical trial data regarding efficacy of dong quai for menopausal symptoms are inconclusive . A small study done in men with hot flashes did not find dong quai effective \nDong quai exhibits estrogenic activity in vitro  and stimulates proliferation of MCF-7 cells . Until definitive efficacy and safety data are available, patients with hormonal-sensitive cancers should avoid this herb.",

        "Dysmenorrhea",
        "Health maintenance",
        "Menopausal symptoms",
        "Premenstrual syndrome",
        "Spasms"
      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "Ferulic acid, one of the constituents of Dong quai, may play an important role in the treatment of osteoarthritis by reducing the hydrogen peroxide-induced interleukin IL-1beta, tumor necrosis factor TNF-alpha, matrix metalloproteinases MMP-1 and MMP-13 and by increasing SOX9 gene expression. SOX9 is a protein involved in the establishment and maintenance of the phenotype of chondrocytes . Dong quai polysaccharides demonstrated anti-osteoarthritic activity by stimulating Insulin like growth factor 1 (IGF1) and IGF1 receptor gene expression, which resulted in promoting UDP-sugars and glycosaminoglycan synthesis due to up-regulation of gene expression of UDP-sugar synthases . Another compound promoted wound healing and bone regeneration by inducing osteoblast proliferation and hyaluronic acid deposition \nAn aqueous extract from dong quai was reported to have estrogen-agonist activity, and stimulated proliferation of both estrogen receptor-positive and negative breast cancer cells . It also afforded protection against radiation-induced pneumonitis by down regulating proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha and TGF-beta1 in a murine model . Subcutaneous injection of dong quai extract also protected mice against cyclophosphamide-induced cytotoxicity by promoting recovery from leukopenia . The antitumor effects of dong quai may be due to its inhibitory effects on invasion and metastasis of carcinoma cells  and by suppression of tumor growth  that may be mediated by Nur77-dependent apoptosis . Furthermore, dong quai extracts promote angiogenesis by inducing proliferation and migration of endothelial cells by upregulating VEGF expression ",
      "Contraindications": [
        "Pregnant and breastfeeding women should avoid dong quai",
        "Patients taking anticoagulants should avoid dong quai as it can potentiate their effects",
        "Patients with hormone-sensitive cancers should avoid dong quai because it has estrogenic effects"

      "Side Effects": "Common: Headache, dizziness, nausea, constipation, mild stomach pain, skin rash, irritationRare: Serious allergic reactionsCase Reports – Oral\nWorsening of a chronic blistering skin disease: In a 55-year-old man with a history of pemphigus vulgaris, which was controlled with immunosuppressants. Only partial remission was reported after he was treated again with immunosuppressants.Reduced white blood cell count: In a 51-year-old woman following chronic use of echinacea. Her white blood cell count returned to normal levels 7 months after discontinuing echinacea supplements.Severe hepatitis: In a 45-year-old man who complained of fatigue and jaundice lasting one week, linked to daily high doses of echinacea used to strengthen his immune system after catching the cold.Increased eosinophil count in the bloodstream: In a 58-year-old man, there was an increase in this type of white blood cell following use of echinacea. His symptoms improved after discontinuing echinacea.Low platelet and blood-coagulation disorders: Two case reports involve a 61-year-old cancer patient whose use of echinacea likely interacted with etoposide, and a 32-year-old man who used echinacea to alleviate respiratory symptoms.Severe acute liver failure: In a 2-year-old girl, likely cause by echinacea toxicity.Case Report – Topical\nEye irritation and conjunctivitis: 7 reports following use of topical echinacea were received by The National Registry of Drug-Induced Ocular Side Effects. Symptoms resolved after discontinuing echinacea.",
      "Special Point": "Echinacea supplements available in stores contain varying amounts and different species of echinacea. Therefore, the beneficial results seen with echinacea in clinical trials may not apply to a product that contains a different species or quality of this herb. One study found that about half of the echinacea brands tested did not contain the type or quality of echinacea that they claimed on the label.",
      "Brand Name": "Echinagard®, Echinacin®, Echinaforce® Hotdrink",
      "Scientific Name": "Echinacea purpurea, Echinacea angustifolia, Echinacea pallida",
      "Clinical Summary": "The genus Echinacea belongs to the family Compositae, commonly referred to as the sunflower family. Of the known species, E. purpureaE. angustifolia, and E. pallida are commonly used in herbal medicine. Extracts derived from the root and aerial parts are widely used in Europe and the United States as nonspecific immunostimulants and to prevent or treat the common cold and influenza. However, natural products differ greatly in composition , mainly due to the use of different species, variable plant materials or extraction methods, and the addition of other components. In vitro and in vivo studies suggest immunostimulatory and anti-inflammatory effects . A standardized echinacea preparation inactivated influenza viruses  and may improve respiratory activity . In animal models, echinacea stimulated erythropoiesis, increased blood-oxygen transport , produced anxiolytic effects , and exhibited wound-healing properties Clinical data indicate that echinacea is ineffective in preventing the common cold caused by rhinoviruses  or in treating upper respiratory infections . Studies of its ability to reduce incidence and duration of the common cold yielded mixed results . Other analyses do not indicate any benefits for treating colds, and weak evidence for a prophylactic benefit , but a large randomized trial found an echinacea formulation to be as effective as oseltamivir for influenza, and with fewer adverse events in the echinacea group . Small studies have shown that a standardized echinacea root extract has immunomodulating activity ; and an echinacea/sage spray was useful in treating acute sore throats . Preliminary data on improving or enhancing athletic performance are mixed . But a topical echinacea extract was reported effective in alleviating symptoms associated with atopic eczema . Echinacea may also have anticancer potential evidenced by the cytotoxic effects exerted by an extract and a major compound, cichoric acid, in human colon cancer cells Some studies suggest that echinacea could decrease plasma levels, affect therapeutic efficacy, or cause adverse effects with some anticancer drugs . In HIV-infected patients, co-administration with etravirine was found to be safe and well tolerated . In a large population-based study, use of echinacea was associated with a slight increase in diastolic blood pressure . There is insufficient evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of echinacea during pregnancy ",
      "Purported Uses2": [
        "Common cold",
        "Immunostimulation",
        "Viral infections",
        "Wound healing"
      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "Echinacea’s active constituents include cichoric and caftaric acids, polysaccharides, and alkylamides . Immune-modulating effects of a standardized echinacea root extract include upregulation of interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-8 and downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and IL-6 . Immunemodulation by alkylamides occurs through binding to human cannabinoid receptors 1 and 2, and by inhibiting TNF-alpha . Alkylamides may also be responsible for anti-inflammatory effects . Although echinacea does not appear to have significant ergogenic or anabolizing effects, it appears to enhance the immune system and decrease oxidative damage In vitro and in vivo, echinacea extracts were shown to stimulate phagocytosis, enhance mobility of leukocytes, stimulate TNF and IL-1 secretion from macrophages and lymphocytes, and improve respiratory activity . However, their effects on innate immunity such as phagocytosis could not be confirmed, and showed only minimal effects on tumor progression, although echinacea did stimulate natural killer cell activity . Other studies suggest that bacterial components of echinacea are responsible for immune benefits, as total bacterial load differences and content of bacterial lipopolysaccharides within echinacea samples have correlated with NF-kappaB activation in THP-1 cells In human colon cancer cells, cichoric acid decreased telomerase activity and induced apoptosis via DNA fragmentation, caspase-9 activation, poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage and beta-catenin downregulation . Differential effects of echinacea on intestinal and hepatic CYP3A activities may be due to systemic unavailability of locally-acting constituents that inhibit CYP3A, or rapid absorption of these constituents that limits intestinal exposure and CYP3A induction, or a systemically-formed constituent metabolite that is capable of inducing hepatic but not intestinal CYP3A ",
      "Contraindications": [
        "Patients undergoing chemotherapy should use caution with echinacea, as it may reduce the efficacy of some anticancer medications or cause adverse effects",
        "Patients with allergies or asthma should exercise caution with echinacea, as allergic reactions have been reported",
        "Patients undergoing blepharoplasty (eyelid surgery), should avoid echinacea because of added increased risk of dry eye syndrome"
      ],
      "Adverse Reactions": "Common: Headache, dizziness, nausea, constipation, gastrointestinal upset, rash Rare: Dermatitis, anaphylaxis Case Reports – Oral Profound thrombocytopenia: In a 61-year-old man with nonsmall cell lung cancer who was concurrently taking echinacea while receiving chemoradiation with cisplatin and etoposide Severe thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP): In a 32-year-old man following ingestion of echinacea to alleviate upper respiratory tract infection symptoms. TTP resolved after treatment for a month Pemphigus vulgaris exacerbation: In a 55-year-old man with a history of the condition which was controlled with immunosuppressants. Exacerbation was linked to consumption of echinacea, and only partial remission was regained after he was treated again with immunosuppressants Asymptomatic leukopenia: In a 51-year-old woman following chronic use of echinacea. Her white blood cell count returned to normal levels 7 months after discontinuing echinacea supplements Severe acute hepatitis: In a 45-year-old man who complained of fatigue and jaundice lasting one week, linked to the ingestion of daily high doses of echinacea used to strengthen his immune system after catching the cold Severe acute liver failure: In a 2-year-old girl, likely secondary to echinacea toxicity Hypereosinophilia: In a 58-year-old man following echinacea consumption, with symptoms improving after discontinuing echinacea Bilateral central facial palsy and severe quadriparesis: In a 25 year-old male after taking herbal drugs (containing echinacea and many other herbal ingredients) for two weeks. Symptoms improved after conventional treatment Acute cholestatic hepatitis: In a 41-year-old man following consumption of echinacea to strengthen immune system. His condition improved after discontinuing its use Case Reports – Topical Eye irritation and conjunctivitis: 7 reports following use of topical echinacea were received by The National Registry of Drug-Induced Ocular Side Effects. Symptoms resolved after discontinuing echinacea ",
      "Herb-Drug Interactions": "Cytochrome P450 substrates: Echinacea inhibits CYP3A4  and CYP2C8  and can affect the intracellular concentration of drugs metabolized by this enzyme.Cytochrome P3A or CYP1A2 substrate drugs: Caution should be used when echinacea is coadministered with drugs dependent on CYP3A or CYP1A2 for their elimination Tamoxifen: In vitro studies suggest concurrent echinacea use may result in subtherapeutic systemic exposure of prodrugs such as tamoxifen, reducing their efficacy Docetaxel: In a study of cancer patients receiving docetaxel, echinacea at the recommended dosage did not significantly alter docetaxel pharmacokinetics Etoposide: Echinacea caused profound thrombocytopenia in a patient receiving etoposide, likely due to the inhibition of CYP3A4 P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate drugs: In vitro, echinacea has been shown to inhibit P-gp activity , but the clinical significance of this is uncertain as echinacea supplementation in humans did not affect digoxin pharmacokinetics Oseltamivir: In vitro, echinacea reduced the formation of the active drug and may therefore reduce efficacy, but clinical significance is as yet undetermined Immunosuppressants: Echinacea may antagonize the effects of immunosuppressants ",

      "How It Works": "Elderberry may reduce flu symptoms, but sufficient evidence is lacking to support its use to treat any condition.Elderberry flowers and fruit are found in remedies to reduce cold and flu symptoms, and a few small studies have demonstrated that effect. The berries are rich in nutrients, but raw elderberries are inedible and must be properly cooked before they can be ingested.Several components in elderberry may also block infection, but more studies are needed. Laboratory studies indicate that the chemopreventive properties of elderberry are weak, and elderberry has not been found effective for cardiovascular disease or to improve cholesterol levels. Unsubstantiated claims that elderberry prevents or treats AIDS, diabetes, or other diseases have recently been halted by the FDA. Importantly, patients should not forego or avoid legitimate treatments, and consult their physicians about the use of elderberry when being treated for various conditions.",

      "Clinical Summary": "Elderberry belongs to a family of flowering shrubs known as Sambucus or Elder. They are native to Europe but have become naturalized in many parts of the world including the United States. Cultivated for medicinal and food purposes, the fruit is used to produce jams, syrups, and wine. Elderberry flowers and fruit are incorporated in remedies to reduce cold and flu symptoms, for inflammation and respiratory diseases , and as a laxative . The berries are a rich source of anthocyanins and other phenolics and nutrients . Several species of Sambucus produce elderberries with similar chemical compositions including American Elder (Sambucus canadensis) and Blue Elder (Sambucus caerulea) , but European Elder (Sambucus nigra) is the type most studied and used in supplements.In vitro studies demonstrate that elderberries possess antiviral , antibacterial , antidiabetic , immunomodulatory , antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and chemopreventive properties , although inhibition of cancer cell growth was shown to be weak . Flavonoids and proanthocyanidins were shown to block HIV1 infection, and may have additive effects with existing HIV drugs such as enfuvirtide . Elderberry also conferred protective effects against oxidative stressors in endothelial cells . However, in vitro studies did not find it to be vasoprotective  and randomized trials found it ineffective for both cardiovascular disease biomarkers  and improving cholesterol levels . Small randomized trials found that elderberry significantly reduced influenza symptoms , and was safe and effective in a preparation for chronic constipation , but more studies are needed before any conclusions can be drawn.Unsubstantiated claims that elderberry prevents or treats various diseases including AIDS, diabetes and flu have recently been halted by the FDA . This is particularly important as patients may forego or avoid legitimate treatments.",

        "Inflammation",
        "Respiratory infections",
        "Sinusitis"
      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "Elderberry inhibits H1N1 activities by binding to H1N1 virions and blocking host cell recognition and entry . It may also prevent HIV1 infection by binding to viral glycoproteins such as gp120 , but additional investigations are required to clarify those mechanisms . Elderberry’s anti-inflammatory effects may result from increased cytokine production  or inhibition of nuclear transcription factor kappaB and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase . An elderberry extract improved metabolic disturbances in a murine model of obesity by lowering serum triglycerides, inflammatory markers and insulin resistance . Its antidiabetic properties occur via activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma and stimulation of insulin-dependent glucose uptake . Elderberry may also influence HDL dysfunction associated with chronic inflammation by affecting hepatic gene expression in hyperlipidemic mice . Another study indicates its chemopreventive potential is related to induction of quinone reductase as well as cyclooxygenase-2 and ornithine decarboxylase inhibition ",

      "How It Works": "Ellagic acid is found in many foods that are part of a healthy diet, but there is no evidence to support its use for cancer treatment.\nEllagic acid is a naturally occurring compound called a tannin, found in red raspberries, strawberries, and walnuts. It has been studied in the laboratory, but not in humans. In laboratory animals, ellagic acid showed cancer-preventive properties. For example, rats fed ellagic acid before and during exposure to carcinogens (cancer-causing substances) developed fewer liver tumors than rats fed a normal diet. Similar results were shown in mice with lung or esophageal cancer. Scientists think that ellagic acid exerts these effects in two ways. First, ellagic acid enhances the activity of certain detoxification enzymes in the liver, speeding up the removal of dangerous substances from the body, while it also inhibits the cytochrome P450 liver enzymes and may prevent them from metabolizing carcinogens into more dangerous forms. Second, ellagic acid causes changes in the cell cycle of cancer cells in the test tube, leading to cell death.",

          "To prevent cancer",

Other studies have reported that ellagic acid is a potent antioxidant \nPre-clinical studies indicate anticarcinogenic effects of ellagic acid against liver, esophageal, prostate, and colorectal cancer cell lines . It was also shown to induce apoptosis and potentiate all-trans retinoic acid myeloid differentiation therapy in human leukemia HL-60 cells . Human studies have yet to be conducted.\nIn another study, pomegranate-derived ellagitannins exhibited anti-aromatase activity and suppressed testosterone-induced breast cancer cell proliferation, but ellagic acid did not have such effects  ",

Ellagic acid’s ability to induce detoxification enzymes NADPH and quinone reductase contribute to some of its chemopreventive activities .

All parts of the tree, especially the fruit, are commonly used in traditional medicine for various ailments including diarrhea, jaundice, headaches, inflammation, and as a tonic . It is also one of the constituents of a popular Ayurvedic formulation, Triphala.The activity of E. officinalis is often attributed to its antioxidant constituents, such as ascorbic acid, polyphenols, flavonoids, and tannins . In vitro and in vivo studies indicate antioxidant , antibacterial , hepatoprotective  , cardioprotective  radioprotective , antiulcerogenic , antitumor , analgesic , antidiabetic  and antihyperlipidemic  properties.Clinical data are limited to a few studies that show benefit in patients with uremia (accumulation of constituents in the blood that are normally eliminated in the urine) by reducing oxidative stress ; improving HDL and lower LDL-cholesterol levels in diabetic patients ; and lowering lipid levels and blood pressure in patients with hyperlipidemia . Supplementation with an E. officinalis extract was shown to lower multiple risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease in overweight adults Because E. officinalis exhibits strong antioxidant effects, it may interfere with chemotherapy and radiation therapy.",

        "Hyperlipidemia"
      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "The antioxidant activity of E. officinalis is attributed to the high content of ascorbic acid , but it was discovered that such effects may be due to the tannins, Emblicanin A and Emblicanin B . The antidiabetic property is thought to be due to the herb’s ability to reduce release of inflammatory cytokines that cause insulin resistance E. officinalis may also play a role in preventing age-related hyperlipidemia by reducing nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) protein levels via inhibiting NF-kappa B activation . In another study the herbextracts were shown to induce apoptosis in mature osteoclasts, an effect that may limit bone resorption in pathologies associated with bone loss . And a hydroalcoholic extract of E. officinalis demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects by increasing glutathione, superoxide dismutase, and catalase activities, and subsequently decreasing lipid peroxidation Several studies have also investigated the antitumor properties of E. officinalis. Pyrogallol, a component of E. officinalis extract, was found to cause cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase, inhibit proliferation, and induce apoptosis in human lung adenocarcinoma (H441) and squamous cell cancer (H520) cell lines . Intraperitoneal pyrogallol injections also suppressed subcutaneous tumor growth in mice . An aqueous extract decreased tumor volume through inhibiting the cell cycle regulating enzyme CDC25 . Progallin, extracted from E. officinalis leaves, also caused cell cycle arrest in the G1/M and G2/M phase, inhibited proliferation, and induce apoptosis in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (BEL-7404) . In other studies, E. officinalis extracts were shown to inhibit cell growth both in vitro and in vivo possibly via inhibition of angiogenesis and activation of autophagy in ovarian cancer cells ; and demonstrated cardioprotective effects against doxorubicin toxicity in vitro , attributed to antioxidants.",

      "How It Works": "Ephedra is a stimulant that has caused heart attack and stroke resulting in several deaths.\nEphedra contains ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, which are known to stimulate the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord). They activate the “fight or flight” response, resulting in constriction of blood vessels, relaxation and dilation of air passages, appetite suppression, and general stimulant effects. While these effects explain the use of ephedra as a decongestant, weight loss supplement, and anti-asthma agent, in high doses ephedra can raise blood pressure and cause adverse reactions such as stroke and heart attack. Even a single dose of an ephedra containing supplement can cause dangerous increases in blood pressure and effects on heart function.Laboratory studies indicate that ephedra also can kill bacteria on contact, reduce inflammation, and cause contraction of the muscles of the uterus. These effects have not been studied in humans.",

It is commonly consumed in low doses and in combination with other herbs to promote urination, to treat asthma, bronchitis and coughs. Ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, the major constituents, are non-selective sympathomimetic agents with both alpha and beta activities and have direct and indirect CNS stimulation effects, which account for the medicinal properties of the herb. Ephedra also has antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties . It has been widely promoted as a natural stimulant and as an appetite suppressant.\nMisuse and overdose of ephedra have resulted in heart attack, stroke, seizure, psychosis and death . Herb-drug interactions are major concerns . A single dose of a weight loss supplement containing ephedra and caffeine increased QTc interval and systolic blood pressure significantly . The FDA has banned the sales of dietary supplements that contain ephedra because of their significant risk to human health ",
      "Purported Uses2": [
        "Asthma",

        "Promote urination",
        "Strength and stamina",
        "Weight loss"
      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "The major alkaloids in ephedra, ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, are CNS stimulants. They are non-selective sympathomimetic agents with both alpha and beta activities. These alkaloids can be used as decongestants because they constrict peripheral blood vessels, but in high doses, they also raise blood pressure . The CNS stimulation property contributes to ephedra’s appetite suppressant effects and its reputation as a weight loss agent . This effect, however, may lead to other cardiovascular adverse reactions such as stroke and heart attack . Ephedra’s antiasthmatic effect arises from its ability to relax bronchial smooth muscle. Studies indicate that ephedra also has antibacterial, anti-inflammatory and uterine stimulatory activities ",
      "Warnings": "The FDA banned the sales of ephedra-containing dietary supplements and consumers are urged not to use these products  as they pose significant health risks ",
      "Contraindications": "Anxiety, hypertension, heart disease, glaucoma, prostate enlargement, hyperthyroidism.\nThe safety of ephedra for use during pregnancy has not been established. Since ephedra can stimulate uterine contraction, women who are pregnant should not consume this product.",
      "Adverse Reactions": "Reported: Hypertension, palpitations, heart attack, stroke, seizures, insomnia, cardiomyopathy, psychosis and death , coronary artery aneurysm and thrombosis , and gastric mucosal injury ",
      "Herb-Drug Interactions": "CNS stimulants: May increase stimulatory effects.Theophylline: May decrease its effectiveness Digoxin: Concomitant use can cause arrhythmia Monoamine-oxidase inhibitors (MAO-I): Concomitant use can cause hypertensive crisis ",

      "Clinical Summary": "Epimedium is an herb used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat fatigue, arthritic pain, nerve pain, and sexual dysfunction. It is thought to alter levels of certain hormones and is marketed as a dietary supplement for libido. Results from in vitro studies suggest that components of Epimedium exhibit antiosteoporotic , neuroprotective  , immunomodulatory , and anticancer effects , as well as anti-HIV activity . Epimedium derivatives may produce radiosensitizing effects  and reverse multidrug resistance  in tumor cells.In one randomized trial, an herbal regimen containing Epimedium-derived flavonoids was shown to prevent bone loss in postmenopausal women . The few other clinical trials published tend to combine this herb in a botanical “recipe,” confounding the determination of any specific contributions from Epimedium or its components. Further, the safety of such phytotherapeutic compounds needs to be determined.Patients with hormone-sensitive cancers should use Epimedium with caution as it demonstrated estrogenic effects . Cancer patients may experience sexual dysfunction symptoms including painful intercourse, loss of libido, and difficulty in maintaining arousal. These problems are often multifactorial and can be caused by stress, distress, and hormonal changes, as well as treatments involving surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, or hormone therapy. Therefore, patients should consult and be monitored by a physician to properly address individual symptoms of sexual dysfunction.",

        "Fatigue",
        "Osteoporosis",

      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "Icariin, a major active constituent of Epimedium, promotes estrogen biosynthesis, and enhances aromatase mRNA and protein expression as well as alkaline phosphatase activity in vitro . However, other studies have attributed estrogen-like activity to icariin derivatives icaritin and desmethylicaritin, rather than icariin itself . Icariin can also exhibit a mild phosphodiesterase-5 inhibition effect . It has been implicated in differentiation of stem cells into cardiomyocytes via cell cycle regulation, induction of apoptosis, modulation of reactive oxygen species generation, and the regulation of various signaling pathways . In undifferentiated neuronal cell lines, it exhibited neuroprotective effects through LDH leakage attenuation which reduced GSH depletion, prevented DNA oxidation damage, and inhibited caspase-3 and p53 activation; and inhibited JNK/p38 MAPK pathways . Icariin was also shown to reduce viability of  human esophageal cancer cells by regulating apoptotic signaling, which is mediated by endoplasmic reticulum stress Icaritin, a prenylflavonoid derivative, induced sustained activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway and apoptosis in both breast  and endometrial cancer cells . It also induced G2/M phase cell-cycle arrest and downregulated G2/M regulatory protein expression . Its radiosensitizing effects suggest ERK1/2 and AKT pathway suppression, enhanced apoptosis, and induced G2/M blockage . Also, icaritin may reverse doxorubicin resistance in human hepatoma cells by increasing intracellular drug accumulation, and by decreasing MDR1 and P-glycoprotein expression . In another study, addition of an epimedium extract to gefitinib was shown effective against drug resistance caused by T790M mutation in non-samll cell lung cancer cells ",

      "How It Works": "Evidence for whether evening primrose oil can relieve some types of pain or skin conditions is mixed, and it has not been adequately studied for its effects on cancer.\nEvening primrose oil has been used for a variety of conditions including rheumatoid arthritis, premenstrual syndrome (PMS), menopause symptoms, and eczema. It has also been used for several types of pain, including breast and diabetic nerve pain. Human studies are mixed on whether it can help relieve breast pain, PMS, nerve pain, or skin inflammation. Other studies suggest possible benefits in conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis. More studies are needed to confirm these effects. There are few studies with respect to its effects on cancer.Interestingly, although evening primrose oil may decrease hot flash intensity in menopausal women, other data suggest that behavioral or lifestyle changes such as increased exercise provide better reliefEvening primrose oil does not have hormonal properties, but some products that contain it may also contain phytoestrogens, which are plant-derived sources of estrogen. Therefore, patients with hormone-sensitive cancers should use evening primrose oil products with caution.",

      "Special Point": "Evening primrose oil does not have hormonal properties, but some products that contain it may also contain phytoestrogens, which are plant-derived sources of estrogen. Therefore, patients with hormone-sensitive cancers should use evening primrose oil products with caution.",
      "Scientific Name": "Oenothera biennis",
      "Clinical Summary": "Derived from the plant Oenothera biennis, evening primrose oil is used for rheumatoid arthritis, premenstrual syndrome, eczema, fatigue, diabetic neuropathy, and mastalgia. The mucilaginous stem and leaf juices have been used as a poultice to treat minor bruises and wounds, and to soothe skin inflammation . Evening primrose oil is thought to improve skin moisture and to reduce transepidermal water loss . It is also among the popular natural products used to relieve menopausal symptoms . In vitro, evening primrose oil demonstrates anti-inflammatory activity  and inhibits platelet aggregation . In animal models, it exerts anti-angiogenic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-arthritic effects  and improved cardiac recovery after myocardial infarction Small clinical studies suggest its effectiveness against atopic dermatitis , but other analyses have concluded that neither evening primrose oil nor borage oil are effective for eczema . A small study in acne patients treated with oral isotretinoin suggests that evening primrose oil can improve xerotic cheilitis , and may be effective against 5-azacitidine-induced skin reactions in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) . It was also found useful in preventing weight regain following extensive weight loss . A meta-analysis suggests it may relieve rheumatoid arthritis symptoms . Other studies show modest benefit in patients with ulcerative colitis  or in ocular surface diseases such as dry eye . Results from previous studies that evaluated possible benefits for diabetic neuropathy patients were equivocal . But several studies suggest that co-supplementation with hemp seed and evening primrose oils along with a diet high in total antioxidant capacity may improve clinical and immunological parameters in patients with multiple sclerosis Additional data indicate that supplementation with vitamin E and evening primrose oil reduced cyclical mastalgia , but other analyses did not find improvements in breast pain  or premenstrual syndrome . Evening primrose oil may improve quality of life and decrease hot flash intensity in menopausal women , although other data suggest that behavioral/lifestyle approaches such as exercise provide better relief . It has not been studied extensively for cancer, but a study involving liver cancer patients showed no effect on tumor size or survival . Another small study suggested that gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) may be an effective adjunctive therapy for breast cancer Although evening primrose oil does not have intrinsic estrogenic properties, some commercial products combine evening primrose oil with phytoestrogens. Therefore, patients with hormone-sensitive cancers should use evening primrose oil products with caution.",

        "Menopausal symptoms",
        "Premenstrual syndrome",
        "Rheumatoid arthritis"
      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "Evening primrose oil is rich in omega-6 gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), which can be converted directly to the prostaglandin precursor dihomo-GLA (DGLA) . Administration of the oil may benefit individuals unable to metabolize cis-linolenic acid to GLA, producing subsequent intermediates of metabolic significance including prostaglandins In vitro, long-chain fatty alcohols such as hexacosanol, tetracosanol, docosanol, and octocosanol demontrate anti-inflammatory activity . In animal models, benefits on cardiac recovery after myocardial infarction are attributed to its hypocholesterolemic effect and indirect influence on prostaglandins and cytokine synthesis . In arthiritis models, evening primrose oil normalized body weight, angiopoietin-1, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels, and reduced malondialdehyde levels, synovial hyperplasia, and inflammatory cell invasion in joint tissues In patients with multiple sclerosis, evening primrose oil accelerates anti-inflammatory responses and prevents pro-inflammatory cytokine production while helping to maintain fatty acid membranes and optimizing balance between saturated and unsaturated fatty acids . Increases in plasma GLA and its metabolite DGLA seen with evening primrose oil supplementation has correlated with clinical improvements in atopic dermatitis  and produced dose-dependent effects on serum fatty acid levels and eczema severity scores . Inhibition of cheilitis is attributed to GLA’s effects on stratum corneum maturation, differentiation, and preservation of its permeability barrier . Antiplatelet and anticoagulant effects are likely related to decreased thromboxane B2 synthesis induced by evening primrose oil ",
      "Contraindications": [
        "Pregnant women should not take evening primrose oil due to increased risk of pregnancy complications",
        "Patients with hormone-sensitive cancers should use evening primrose oil products with caution, because even though it does not possess estrogenic properties on its own, some commercial evening primrose oil products may contain other phytoestrogen ingredients."
      ],
      "Adverse Reactions": "Minor: abdominal pain, indigestion, nausea, softening of stools, and headaches Labor abnormalities: When used to shorten gestation and length of labor, increased incidences of prolonged membrane rupture, oxytocin augmentation, arrest of descent, and vacuum extraction Case reports Petechiae and ecchymoses: Observed in a newborn whose mother used raspberry leaf tea and evening primrose oil vaginally and orally 1 week before childbirth Lipoid pneumonia: In a 50-year-old woman following chronic use of evening primrose oil, caused by aspiration of lipid particles into the lungs ",
      "Herb-Drug Interactions": "Anticoagulants/Antiplatelets: May have additive effects and increase bleeding risk Blood pressure medications: Although there are no interactions reported with blood pressure medications, evening primrose oil was identified as being among supplements that may increase both systolic and diastolic blood pressures, with a clinically meaningful difference for systolic blood pressure in a large population-based study Antiretrovirals: When used concurrently, evening primrose oil significantly increases the levels of antiretroviral drugs, and can increase the risk of adverse effects ",

      "How It Works": "Fenugreek may lower blood glucose and cholesterol levels in people with diabetes.Much research on fenugreek has been conducted in India and other countries, focusing on its potential for the treatment of diabetes. In healthy and diabetic animals and humans, fenugreek lowers cholesterol, blood triglyceride levels, and blood glucose levels. Scientists are not certain how this effect happens, but propose that the fiber in fenugreek binds to glucose and cholesterol in the digestive tract and prevents it from being absorbed by the body, or increases insulin secretion. Laboratory studies in rats show that fenugreek normalizes their blood levels of antioxidants and metabolic enzymes, but it is unclear whether this effect occurs in humans. Fenugreek has anticancer properties but human studies are needed.\nFenugreek acts as an estrogenic receptor modulator and was shown to stimulate breast cancer cells in vitro. Patients with hormonal-sensitive cancers should avoid this product.",

      "Mechanism of Action": "The hypoglycemic activity of fenugreek may be associated with the galactomannan fiber and saponin components that reduce gastrointestinal glucose and cholesterol absorption, and increase bile acid excretion . Hypoglycemic activity is also attributed to the trigonelline, nicotinic acid, and coumarin fractions. 4-Hydroxyisoleucine, an amino acid constituent of fenugreek, potentiates insulin secretion in non-insulin-dependent diabetic (NIDD) rats when administered intraperitoneally . In addition to lower fasting and postprandial glucose levels, fenugreek-treated diabetic rats have higher hemoglobin, GSH, and plasma antioxidant levels and lower glycosylated hemoglobin, plasma lipids, and TBARS levels than diabetic controls . Dietary fenugreek also normalizes the activities of glucose and lipid-metabolizing enzymes in diabetic rats . Studies involving healthy mice and rats indicate that dietary fenugreek is associated with increased serum T4, liver GSH, glyoxalase I, and GST activities, and decreased T3 levels and T3/T4 ratio . Fenugreek intake in humans was associated with an increase in molar insulin binding sites of erythrocytes, which may enhance glucose utilization In MCF-7 estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cells, fenugreek extract induced cell cycle arrest as well as apoptosis ",

One such compound, parthenolide, was found to block the formation of inflammatory proteins. A feverfew extract was shown to reduce the number of migraine attacks and also decrease the mild headache that occurs before a migraine attack.Feverfew also showed anticancer effects in lab studies. Human studies are needed.",

      "Scientific Name": "Tanacetum parthenium",
      "Clinical Summary": "Feverfew is a plant that belongs to the daisy/sunflower family of flowering plants. It is widely used in traditional medicine for the treatment of fevers, migraine headaches, rheumatoid arthritis, stomach ache, toothache, insect bites and infertility.Although much of its activity is attributed to the compound parthenolide, a parthenolide-free extract of feverfew demonstrated free radical-scavenging properties, affording protection against UV-induced sun damage . Feverfew extracts also possess antiprotozoal , antibacterial , anti-inflammatory , and antioxidant  properties.In clinical trials, a feverfew extract reduced the frequency of migraine attacks  and a feverfew/ginger formulation prevented mild headache before the onset of moderate to severe headache in patients with migraine . In another study, a combination of feverfew and acupuncture treatments led to greater improvements in quality of life in women with migraine, compared with feverfew or acupuncture alone . Despite anti-inflammatory benefits, a clinical trial did not find benefit for patients with rheumatoid arthritis Parthenolide from feverfew has demonstrated anticancer effects in vitro . A phase I clinical study involving cancer patients showed that up to 4 mg of parthenolide was well tolerated; however, parthenolide could not be detected in the plasma . Consequently, a synthetic analog dimethylamino-parthenolide (DMAPT), a more hydrophilic form of parthenolide, with greater bioavailability was identified. Oral administration of DMAPT has been found to be safe and resulted in increased plasma concentrations in an animal model . More studies are warranted.",

        "Dysmenorrhea",
        "Migraine prophylaxis",
        "Psoriasis"
      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "The sesquiterpene lactones, particularly parthenolide, are the active constituents responsible for feverfew’s beneficial effects. Parthenolide attenuates activation of the NF-kappa B complex to block transcription of inflammatory proteins . The inhibition of this pathway also leads to decreased platelet activity . Other mechanisms that produce antiplatelet activity by parthenolide include sulfhydryl group alterations, changes in protein kinase C interactions, and arachidonic acid metabolism . The flavonol content also has anti-inflammatory effects In vitro studies suggest various activities induced by parthenolide can produce antiproliferative effects. In colorectal cancer cells, it suppresses angiogenesis by reducing VEGF and VEGF-receptor expression.  In cervical and breast cancer cell lines, parthenolide modulates apoptosis-regulating gene expression  and activates both apoptosis pathway and AMPK-autophagy survival pathway through ROS generation .

      "How It Works": "Flaxseed appears to be effective in reducing menopausal symptoms, but evidence of its ability to reduce cholesterol levels is mixed.\nFlaxseed is a very concentrated source of phytoestrogenic compounds called lignans, which have hormone-like effects on the body (soybeans are another source of phytoestrogens). These lignans are likely the reason why flaxseed can affect menstrual cycle length and menopausal symptoms. It contains alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), a building block of omega-3 fatty acids. ALA has been shown to have numerous effects on the body including protecting the kidneys from damage. Results from clinical studies are mixed on flaxseed’s ability to reduce cholesterol. Other studies suggest it may help some aspects of diabetes or related conditions, especially along with other lifestyle modifications. Flaxseed has also been shown to affect intracellular signals within the body that may play a role in breast and prostate cancer growth. Because flaxseed has phytoestrogenic effects, patients with estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer should use flaxseed with caution.",

      "Clinical Summary": "Flaxseed has been used in traditional medicine to treat coughs, colds, constipation, urinary tract infections, as a topical demulcent and as an emollient . It is rich in omega-3 fatty acids and phytoestrogenic lignans. Flaxseed was shown to have chemoprotective effects in postmenopausal women , conferred renoprotection in patients with lupus nephritis , and improved mild menopausal symptoms . Supplementation with a major lignan derived from flaxseed improved glycemic control in Type-2 diabetic patients , and a meta analysis showed significant reductions in blood pressure following supplementation with flaxseed products . In prediabetic patients, daily flaxseed powder also lowered blood pressure but did not improve insulin resistance or glycemic indices . In other studies, flaxseed supplementation plus lifestyle modification was more effective than lifestyle modification alone to manage metabolic syndrome  and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease . In hemodialysis patients, daily flaxseed oil consumption significantly reduced inflammatory markers related to cardiovascular disease . Although flaxseed-derived lignan reduces blood glucose levels in hypercholesterolemic individuals , data on the cholesterol-lowering effects of flaxseed are mixed Flaxseed supplementation may benefit women with polycystic ovarian syndrome by reducing androgen levels ; a moderate reduction of estrogens and androgens was also seen in postmenopausal women . However, lignan supplementation was ineffective in reducing hot flashes in postmenopausal women with or without breast cancer . Flaxseed powder along with Vitex agnus may help to reduce cyclical mastalgia \nFlaxseed has been investigated for its anticancer potential. It was shown to inhibit the growth and metastasis of human breast cancer , prostate cancer  and melanoma  in vitro and in mice. It also reduced radiation therapy-induced lung damage and improved survival . In other studies, flaxseed was shown to lower tumor biomarkers in men with prostate cancer  and in patients with breast cancer , but a flaxseed extract was ineffective in preventing oral infection following radiation treatment for head and neck cancer \nFlaxseed ingestion can increase urinary lignan excretion  and the length of the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle ",

      "Mechanism of Action": "Flaxseed is the most concentrated food source of the plant lignan, secoisolariciresinol, a precursor for enterolactone. It is thought that phytoestrogenic lignans contribute to the plant’s hormonal effects . Flaxseed has been shown to affect the length of the menstrual cycle in premenopausal women . It may also alter estrogen metabolism, increasing the ratio of 2-hydroxyestrogen to 16 alpha-hydroxyestrone in a dose dependent fashion . Flaxseed’s renoprotective effects are thought to be via high concentration of alpha-linolenic acid, an omega-3 fatty acid precursor  or through inhibition of angiogenesis, tyrosine protein kinases and cytokine-induced activation of transcription factors . The laxative effects of flaxseed are likely due to its fiber content In addition, flaxseed’s inhibition of growth of human breast cancer, and metastasis in mice is due in part to the down-regulation of insulin-like growth factor I and expression of epidermal growth factor receptor . Flaxseed was also shown to induce apoptosis by significantly upregulating p53 mRNA in breast cancer cell lines . In another study, flaxseed oil enhanced the effects of trastuzumab in reducing HER2 signaling via the Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, resulting in reduction in cell proliferation and an increase in apoptosis The antiproliferative activity of flaxseed against prostate cancer in mice is attributed to its inhibition of cellular proliferation . The hormonal effects of flaxseed may also play a role in its ability to modulate prostate cancer biology and associated biomarkers , and lower serum lipid levels ",
      "Contraindications": "Because flaxseed has phytoestrogenic effects, patients with estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer should use flaxseed with caution.",
      "Adverse Reactions": "Common: Increased bowel movements , constipation and flatulence Case Reports:\nAnaphylaxis has been reported following ingestion of flaxseeds. \nA case of false polyposis coli on double contrast barium enema , and an increase in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle  were observed after flaxseed supplementation.\nDietary flaxseed was shown to exacerbate dextran sodium sulfate-induced colonic injury and inflammation in mice ",

      "How It Works": "Folate is used to prevent certain types of anemia and birth defects. Studies on increased folate intake or supplements to reduce cancer risk are mixed.\nFolate is a member of the vitamin B complex that must be obtained from food sources like grains, leafy vegetables, and liver. It is important for cell division, and if not consumed enough from food, can lead to anemia and birth defects. Folic acid is a form of folate used as a supplement to correct deficiencies. It is also added to some processed foods to increase dietary consumption.Some studies suggest adequate folate intake can help reduce the risk of Alzheimer’s disease, heart diseases, and even certain types of cancer, but other studies find increased colon and skin cancer risks.Excess folate from food or supplements may mask a vitamin B12 deficiency in blood tests. Therefore, patients should speak with their doctors before taking this supplement.",
      "Purported Uses": [
        [
          "To treat Alzheimer’s disease",
          "Studies have linked low dietary folate and low folate levels in the blood with Alzheimer’s disease."
        ],
        [
          "To prevent cancer",
          "Some studies have shown that higher levels of folate reduce the risk for various cancers, but other studies found it may increase precancerous colon abnormalities or skin cancer risk. Therefore, more research is needed to understand the relationships between folate levels, supplementation, and cancer risks or prevention."
        ],
        [
          "To prevent heart disease",
          "Low folic acid levels have been linked to higher homocysteine levels, a risk factor for heart disease-related death. However, further studies are needed to understand this association."
        ],
        [
          "To prevent neural tube birth defects",
          "Studies have shown a significant decrease in risk of neural tube (embryo tissue that develops into the brain and spinal cord) birth defects with increased dietary folate."

      "Scientific Name": "Pteroylglutamic acid",
      "Clinical Summary": "Folate is an essential member of the vitamin B complex family that is naturally available in grains, green leafy vegetables, and liver. Folic acid and the L-methylfolate (5-MTHF) derivative are synthetic supplemental forms that have higher bioavailability . Folate is important in cell growth and division and involved in the methylation process and DNA synthesis. Inadequate intake can cause deficiency leading to megaloblastic anemia.Folate is essential during pregnancy. Supplementation has been shown to reduce risks of neural tube birth defects  and medulloblastoma in offspring . In high doses (5 mg/day), it reduced homocysteine levels at time of delivery and may lessen pregnancy complications . Folate supplementation may benefit women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) . High folate intake also reduced chromosomal aberrations in sperm of healthy men In other studies, folic acid has been shown effective in decreasing levels of homocysteine, a risk factor for cardiovascular disease mortality , and reducing blood pressure in smokers . Among hypertensive adults, it reduced risk of first stroke associated with elevated total cholesterol  and serum uric acid . However, other trials on stroke risk yielded mixed results Folic acid supplementation improved cognitive function in older adults . In patients with Alzheimer’s disease, it improved response to cholinesterase inhibitors , cognition, and inflammatory markers . In individuals chronically exposed to arsenic, it lowers blood arsenic concentrations by facilitating urinary excretion Studies on increased folate intake or supplements to reduce cancer risk are mixed. In young children, folic acid fortification was associated with reduced incidence of Wilms tumor and primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNET) . Folate supplementation also helps cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN 1) regression . Low levels of folate in the blood are associated with certain forms of cancer , whereas higher levels of dietary folate have been shown to reduce the risk of breast  and pancreatic cancers , but not prostate cancer . Studies on colorectal cancer risk produced mixed results  and some even suggest a negative effect . A large population study suggests an association between dietary folate intake and increased risk for overall skin cancer, basal cell carcinoma, and nonmelanoma skin cancer, particularly in women Overconsumption of folic acid may increase risk of toxicity  and some cancers . Therefore, more research is needed to examine the relationships between folate levels, supplementation, and cancer risks or prevention.Studies that evaluate folate in combination with other B vitamins are largely negative. Folic acid along with vitamins B6 and B12 had no overall effect on invasive cancer or breast cancer , and produced mixed results in studies for older adults with depression . Folic acid + B12 did not improve bone mineral density  or reduce osteoporotic fracture incidence in elderly individuals with elevated plasma homocysteine levels , and may increase cancer incidence and mortality in patients with ischemic heart disease Due to its antagonistic effects, folic acid can reduce the side effects of methotrexate when used for rheumatoid arthritis . However, it may decrease the efficacy of methotrexate in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia  and psoriasis ",
      "Food Sources": "Main sources include fortified breakfast cereals and breads, liver, Brussels sprouts, potatoes, spinach, chickpeas, and brewer’s yeast.",
      "Purported Uses2": [
        "Alzheimer’s disease",
        "Cancer prevention",
        "Cardiovascular disease",
        "Neural tube birth defect prevention"
      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "The bioactive form of folate is tetrahydrofate, which can be converted from folic acid through the action of the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase. Drugs that inhibit this enzyme can reduce folic acid activity. Folate acts as a co-enzyme in the methylation process. The amino acid serine reacts with tetrahydrofolate, resulting in 5,10- methylenetetrahydrofolate, the derivative involved in nucleotide synthesis. 5-methyltetrahydrofolate transfers a methyl group to cobalamin (vitamin B12) and then to homocysteine, converting it to methionine. Methionine is the precursor of the methyl donor, S-adenosyl-methionine (SAMe), which plays a major role in neurological function and several biochemical pathways . Genetic polymorphisms that lowered the production of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) can also reduce SAMe and increase homocysteine levels. Supplementation with folic acid can reduce homocysteine levels and DNA oxidative damage  . This may in turn lower risks for cardiovascular and psychiatric diseases by increasing SAMe . Folic acid supplementation also improves endothelial function DNA methylation and repair is also attributed to the anticancer effect of folate . However, increased intake from fortified foods may actually raise cancer risk . There is evidence that high levels of unmetabolized folic acid in plasma can reduce natural killer cell cytotoxicity ",

      "How It Works": "Forskolin has not been shown to be an effective cancer therapy in human. Large scale clinical studies are needed to support its other uses.Forskolin is a root extract of the Indian plant Coleus forskohlii. It is thought to stimulate a cell enzyme called adenylate cyclase, causing higher-than-normal levels of cAMP, a molecule that is responsible for many cellular effects. Some of these effects include breakdown of fats, dilation of blood vessels and airways, inhibition of blood clotting, and improving heart function. An animal study showed that forskolin can cause tanning when applied directly to the skin without exposure to the sun. It has been proposed to be used in sunless tanning lotion to reduce skin cancer risks. Although these effects have been studied in the laboratory setting, very few clinical trials have been performed to test whether these effects also occur in humans. In a number of studies, forskolin was found to lower pressure in the eye but this effect remains controversial.",

      "Scientific Name": "Coleus forskohlii",
      "Clinical Summary": "Forskolin is a diterpene derived from the root of Coleus forskohlii. It is used for a variety of conditions, including cancer, obesity, glaucoma, asthma, and heart failure. Forskolin was shown in animal studies to promote the activation of adenylate cyclase and increase intracellular concentrations of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) . Small clinical studies suggest that forskolin can benefit obese men in weight management . Forskolin eye drops may reduce intra-ocular pressure  and oral forskolin capsules help reduce asthma attacks . When administered intravenously or inhaled, forskolin has bronchodilation effect . Forskolin also benefits cardiovascular health due to its inotropic , anti-inflammatory  and antiplatelet properties . One study found intra-arterial forskolin daropate to be an effective treatment for cerebral vasospasm in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage . Treatment of uropathogenic E.coli-infected mice with forskolin resulted in reduced number of bacteria via cyclic AMP-regulated exocytosis The anticancer effects of forskolin and its derivatives have also been studied in vitro  and in animal models . When applied on the skin of mice, forskolin can stimulate the production of melanin in the absence of ultraviolet light . It has been proposed for use in sunless tanning lotions to reduce the risk of skin cancer by decreasing exposure to sun. In an in vitro study, an extract of forskolin was found to significantly reduce viral production in human lymphoid CEM-GFP cells infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1NL4) . These effects have yet to be confirmed in human studies.Cases of acute poisoning after the consumption of Coleus forskohlii products, possibly from contaminants, have been reported in Europe ",

        "Glaucoma",
        "Hypertension",
        "Weight loss"
      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "Forskolin activates adenylate cyclase through direct stimulation of enzyme and by modulating enzyme activities. These lead to increase in intracellular concentrations of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) . This may explain the bronchodilation , inotropic , vasodilatory  and antiplatelet  effects of Forskolin. Forskolin has also been reported to increase cellular acetylcholinesterase and protect neuronal cells from organophosphate toxicity . It is thought to reduce body fat and has been studied as a weight loss agent In vitro and animals studies have shown forskolin and its derivative can inhibit cell proliferation, and induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in human gastric cancer cells . Forskolin was also found to inhibit melanoma cell-induced platelet aggregation and reduce lung metastasis . Forskolin upregulates the expression of cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) family through the pregnane-X-receptor that regulates the CYP3A genes ",
      "Warnings": "Forskolin may have a role in promoting cyst enlargement in patients with polycystic kidney disease. It is therefore recommended that these patients avoid the use of all preparations containing this compound ",
      "Adverse Reactions": "Reported: Hypotension, tachycardia , headache ",
      "Herb-Drug Interactions": "Anti-hypertensives: Forskolin may have additive hypotensive effect with beta-blockers, vasodilators, calcium channel blockers, etc. Anticoagulants: Forskolin may cause bleeding due to additive platelet inhibition \nForskolin can induce CYP3A gene expression and can potentially increase the metabolism of drugs that are substrates of related microsomal enzymes ",

      "How It Works": "Fucoidan has anticancer properties, but this has not yet been studied in humans.Fucoidan is a complex polysaccharide found in many species of brown seaweed. It has been shown to slow blood clotting. Laboratory studies suggest that it can prevent the growth of cancer cells and has antiviral, neuroprotective, and immune-modulating effects. Studies in humans have not yet been conducted to determine whether these same anticancer effects may occur. One human study suggests fucoidan may help to enable longer courses of chemotherapy, but more studies are needed to confirm safety and effectiveness. Because of its anti-clotting property, fucoidan may increase the side effects of “blood-thinning” drugs.",

      ],
      "Do Not Take If": "You are taking anticoagulants such as warfarin and heparin: Because fucoidan can slow the blood-clotting process, it may increase bleeding risk when used with these drugs.",
      "Clinical Summary": "Fucoidan is a sulfated polysaccharide found in the cell walls of many species of brown seaweed. In vitro studies show that fucoidan has antitumor, antiangiogenic , antiviral , anti-arthritic , and immunomodulatory  effects. Fucoidan also exhibited neuroprotective , radioprotective , and antiulcer  properties.In animal models, fucoidan exerts anti-inflammatory effects to protect against various organ injuries . Oral administration of fucoidan extracts also improved inflammatory pathology associated with acute colitis . Although a high molecular weight fucoidan did not improve outcomes in mice following intracerebral hemorrhage, it is suggested that low-molecular-weight fucoidans have increased therapeutic potential and should be evaluated for this purpose In humans, dietary fucoidan modulates platelet aggregation via anti-thrombotic effects . In overweight or obese adults, fucoidan administration over 3 months decreased diastolic blood pressure and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations, and increased insulin secretion . Fucoidan administration also decreased pro-viral load in a small group of patients with human T-lymphotropic virus type-1-associated neurological disease . The consumption of fucoisan for a 1-month period prior to seasonal influenza vaccination may boost antibody production after vaccination in immune-compromised elderly Preclinical data suggest that fucoidan can help relieve cyclophosphamide-induced intestinal mucosal injury by altering gut flora, resulting in reduced inflammation and increased expression of tight junction proteins . Oral ingestion of fucoidan in a small group of volunteers was found to improve mobilization of hematopoietic progenitor stem cells with high levels of CXCR4 expression . In advanced stage colorectal cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, fucoidan coadministration enabled patients to continue chemotherapy and regulated fatigue ; fucoidan also reduced the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in another study of advanced cancer patients Because fucoidan demonstrates anticoagulant  and antithrombotic  activities, it may have additive effects when taken with anticoagulants.",

      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "In vitro, a low-molecular-weight fucoidan inhibited human rheumatoid arthritis fibroblast synoviocytes and triggered apoptosis via decreased expression and secretion of metalloproteinase (MMP)-1, MMP-3, and MMP-9, as well as suppression of NF-kappaB binding activity, p65 nuclear translocation, and IkappaB-alpha degradation . In animal models fucoidan treatment protected against liver injury via suppression of the inflammatory signaling pathway, inflammatory mediators, and inflammatory cell infiltration . It also reduced production of cyclooygenase-2 and nitric oxide, while increasing the expression of the hepatoprotective enzyme hemeoxygenase-1 on murine liver and HepG2 cells . Fucoidan suppressed inflammation in an ultraviolet B-irradiated mouse model as evidenced by decreased thickness of the prickle cell layer and decreased MMP-1 In humans, dietary fucoisan shortens lysis time of the thrombus by elevating prostacyclin (PGI2) secretion caused by increased H2O2 production in the blood . Various antitumor, antiviral and immune-modulating effects of fucoidan are attributed to the stimulation of natural killer (NK) cells, downregulation of transcription factor AP-I involved in cellular proliferation, and to the downregulation of IGF-IR signaling through the main IRS-1/PI3K/AKT pathway . In melanoma cells, fucoidan increased the antitumor effects of lapatinib via inhibition of ERBB3, known to promote melanoma metastasis . It was also shown to reduce tumor-promoting M2 macrophages and in combination with etoposide, to prevent HCT116 tumorigenicity in human colorectal cells . Neuroprotective effects are attributed to suppression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)- and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)-induced nitric oxide production in C6 glioma cells  and to its antioxidative effects . Fucoidan inhibits metastasis by preventing adhesion of tumor cells to the extracellular matrix. This is achieved by blocking the fibronectin cell-binding domain, necessary for formation of adhesion complexes . It also induced apoptosis of human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-1) that causes adult T-cell leukemia by inactivating NF-kB, which regulates antiapoptotic proteins . In a murine model, fucoidan suppressed angiogenesis induced by sarcoma 180 cells ",
      "Contraindications": "Because of its anticoagulant property , fucoidan may have additive effects with anticoagulants such as warfarin and heparin.",
      "Adverse Reactions": "Diarrhea, which improved immediately after stopping fucoidan administration ",

      "Scientific Name": "Garcinia gummi-gutta, Garcinia cambogia",
      "Clinical Summary": "Garcinia gummi-gutta, better known by its older name Garcinia cambogia, is a plant native to Southeast Asia. The fruit rinds have antioxidant and anticholinesterase activities , and are used as a flavoring agent and in traditional medicine to treat gastrointestinal ailments. The extract, rich in hydroxycitric acid (HCA), can be found in many products promoted for weight loss or body building.In animal studies, high-dose HCA suppressed epididymal fat accumulation leading to testicular atrophy G. cambogia increased satiety, fatty acid oxidation, and weight loss  and protected against damaging effects of high-fat and high-sugar diets . An ethanol extract of garcinia also has erythropoietic effects In humans, clinical trials suggest HCA does not decrease caloric intake, promote satiety, or affect fat oxidation . However, HCA supplementation improved glycogen synthesis in skeletal muscle and improved post-meal insulin sensitivity in healthy volunteers . Garcinia may improve HDL levels, but effects on other plasma lipids are minimal . Results from randomized controlled trials are mixed and show no significant effect of G. cambogia extract over placebo for weight reduction . A combination of G. cambogia with orlistat had more effects on cardiometabolic profiles and visceral adiposity index than orlistat alone in obese patients Garcinia has also been promoted to cancer patients, although its anticancer effects remain unclear. In vitro, G. cambogia extract and xanthone compounds present in other Garcinia species may have a tumoricidal effect on cancer cells . Murine models show that the combination of HCA and alpha-lipoic acid reduced tumor size for lung carcinoma, bladder transitional cell carcinoma, and melanoma . These effects have not been investigated in humans.G. cambogia and HCA supplements have been associated with liver toxicity, mania, and other herb-drug interactions. Patients who have cancer, diabetes, depression, or other chronic diseases, or women who are pregnant should use G. cambogia with caution.G. cambogia should not be confused with Garcinia mangostana (Mangosteen)",

      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "The negative isomer of hydroxycitric acid ((-)-HCA), is thought to be the most active chemical compound of G. cambogia fruit rind. HCA is theorized to affect weight loss via decreased fatty acid synthesis, appetite suppression, and increased fatty acid metabolism. HCA competitively inhibits ATP-citrate lyase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of citrate to substrates for fatty acid synthesis . Increased citrates in the cytoplasm may reduce glycolysis and increase glycogen synthesis. ATP-citrate lyase is also upregulated in cancer cells with high levels of aerobic glycolysis An animal study observed decreases in leptin and insulin levels in obese mice treated with HCA, which may suggest alterations in glucose metabolism . The iron contents in G. cambogia may contribute to the erythropoietic effect observed in animals ",

      "How It Works": "Garlic was shown to lower blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels. It is associated with decreased risk of some cancers, but there is no evidence that it can treat cancer.Raw garlic contains compounds called alliin and allicin. In laboratory studies, these compounds and their breakdown products have been found to kill bacteria directly, reduce the number of platelets in the blood and slow clotting, and reduce the level of lipids in the blood. Compounds called ajoenes are also responsible for garlic’s ability to prevent blood clots. Garlic may also reduce blood pressure. Garlic intake may protect against certain cancers possibly by decreasing tumor cell growth or stimulating the immune system.Processing can have a significant effect on the amount of active compounds in garlic: Garlic powder and garlic essential oil do not contain allicin or ajoene, compounds believed to be responsible for garlic’s cholesterol-reducing and blood-thinning properties.Because garlic has blood thinning property, patients taking warfarin or other blood thinners should ask their doctor before taking garlic supplements.",

      "Scientific Name": "Allium sativum",
      "Clinical Summary": "Derived from the bulb or clove of the plant, garlic is used as a spice and to treat hyperlipidemia, hypertension, atherosclerosis, cancer, and infections. Because processing can have a substantial effect on the chemical content of garlic (the volatile oil components are sensitive to heat and certain enzymes are acid-labile), the best measure of the total activity of garlic is its ability to produce allicin, which in turn, results in the formation of other active constituents . Several oral garlic formulations are available, and clinical studies have addressed a variety of the proposed claims.\nPlacebo-controlled trials on the cholesterol lowering effect of garlic yielded mixed results , but a systematic review showed that garlic is effective in lowering total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels . Studies evaluating the antithrombotic effects repeatedly show modest reduction in platelet aggregation, but varying levels of fibrinolytic activity; and mixed effects with regard to reductions in blood glucose, blood pressure, or risk of cardiovascular disease . However, meta analyses show that there is consistent evidence to support use of garlic in lowering cardiovascular risk factors ; and that garlic supplements have the potential to decrease blood pressure in hypertensive individuals, to regulate cholesterol levels, and have immunostimulatory effects . Garlic supplementation may also benefit patients with hepatopulmonary syndrome . More data are needed to determine if garlic is effective against common cold  and vaginal candidiasis . Whether garlic is effective in reducing the risk of mortality and cardiovascular morbidity in patients diagnosed with hypertension also remains inconclusive \nAn analysis of several case-controlled studies in Europe suggests an inverse association between garlic consumption and risk of common cancers . High intake of garlic may be protective against gastric  and colorectal cancers ; however, conflicting data indicate that long-term supplementation with garlic does not significantly reduce gastric cancer incidence nor mortality . Garlic intake was inversely associated with cancer of the prostate  and endometrium . In patients with advanced cancers, aged garlic extract (AGE) improved natural killer (NK) cell number and activity, but not quality of life . In patients with a history of adenomas, supplementation with AGE reduced both the number and size of subsequent colorectal adenomas . Garlic supplementation may also be associated with reduced risk of hematologic malignancies \nBecause garlic is known to decrease platelet aggregation and potentially elevate International Normalized Ratio (INR) values, it should not be used with anticoagulants or in patients with platelet dysfunction ",

      "Mechanism of Action": "The intact cells of garlic contain an odorless, sulfur-containing amino acid derivative known as alliin. When the cells are crushed, alliin comes into contact with the enzyme alliinase located in neighboring cells and is converted to allicin. Allicin is a potent antibiotic, but it is highly odoriferous and unstable. It is described as possessing antiplatelet, antibiotic, and antihyperlipidemic activities. Most authorities agree that the best measure of the total activity of garlic is its ability to produce allicin, which, in turn, results in the formation of other active constituents In patients with hyperlipidemia, garlic might lower cholesterol levels by acting as an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor . For atherosclerosis, garlic is believed to reduce oxidative stress and low-density lipoprotein oxidation and have antithrombotic effects . It is also thought to reduce blood pressure by causing smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation by activating the production of endothelium-derived relaxation factor Garlic may stimulate both humoral and cellular immunity, causing T-cell proliferation, restoring suppressed antibody responses , and stimulating macrophage cytotoxicity on tumor cells. It may increase selenium absorption with possible protection against tumorigenesis . In addition, garlic may protect against certain cancers by halting cell cycle progression and inducing apoptosis of cancer cells as well as by decreasing angiogenesis and influencing carcinogen metabolism ",
      "Warnings": "Discontinue use of garlic at least 7 days prior to surgery.",

Although GCP itself has not been studied in the laboratory, genistein and Basidiomycetes mushrooms have, with the following results.\nGenistein has been studied extensively in laboratory experiments. These generally show that genistein, when directly applied to several types of cancer cells (including estrogen receptor (ER+) and (ER-) breast cancer, prostate cancer, neuroblastoma and sarcoma), inhibits their growth and replication. Genistein 1) competes with the body’s own estrogen and 2) inhibits the ability of a growth factor called EGF to stimulate its receptor and cause downstream cellular effects. Estrogen and EGF can enhance the growth of certain tumors (such as ER+ breast cancer), so scientists think that genistein might act against them to slow tumor growth. This theory has not been confirmed in humans through clinical studies, however.Laboratory research has suggested that the polysaccharides in Basidiomycetes mushrooms can slow the growth of tumors, enhance certain activities of immune cells, and kill some bacteria and viruses on contact. It is not clear to what extent these effects occur in the human body.It is controversial whether patients with estrogen-dependent tumors should take soy products such as genistein, due to its possible estrogenic activity. Patients should ask their doctors.",

      "Clinical Summary": "A nutritional supplement prepared by fermenting soy extract with basidiomycetes, genistein combined polysaccharide (GCP) is composed of genistein, a soy isoflavone, and polysaccharides obtained from a variety of mushrooms. Isoflavones have been shown to influence hormone-dependent cancers due to their estrogenic activity. Basidiomycetes express immune-stimulant  and antitumor  activity in vitro. In prostate cancer cells, GCP was found to reduce androgen receptor and prostate specific antigen levels, induce cell growth arrest, and modestly increase apoptosis . GCP was also found to inhibit cell growth and induce apoptosis in androgen-dependent and -independent human prostate cancer cell lines . It potentiated the cytostatic and cytotoxic activities of docetaxel, bicalutamide, and the sRC kinase inhibitor, pp2 . Another study found that GCP treatment resulted in significant inhibition of cell proliferation and arrested the cell cycle in the G2/M phase in three human lymphoid cell lines  Case reports show complete regression of T3 prostate cancer following treatment with GCP ; and supplementation with GCP prevented recurrence of transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the bladder . However, no large scale clinical trials have been performed to verify GCP’s anticancer potential.",

      "Mechanism of Action": "In vitro experiments show that genistein inhibits tyrosine-specific protein kinase activity of EGF receptors. Inhibition is competitive with respect to ATP and noncompetitive to a phosphate acceptor, histone H2B. Genistein bears no structural relationship with ATP, so inhibition may not be due to true competition for the same active site as that utilized by ATP . Basidiomycetes polysaccharides possess antitumor, antiviral, antibacterial and immune-modulating activities. The fermentation of soy extract with basidiomycetes deglycosylates the soy isoflavones which renders them in a highly absorbable form In prostate cancer cells, GCP was found to inhibit mammalian target of rapamycin (MTOR) activity . MTOR is a downstream effector of Akt, an enzyme which plays an important role in cancer cell proliferation and survival .

      "Clinical Summary": "Germanium is a naturally occurring mineral that is used in the manufacturing of electronics and optical equipments. Whereas trace amounts can be found in some foods, it is not thought to be essential for normal body functions. But inorganic and organic germanium products, which have different biological activities, have been promoted to treat wide range of diseases, including cancer and AIDS.\nGermanium compounds have immunomodulating and antioxidant activities . Spirogermanium, an azaspiran compound, was investigated as an anticancer drug. Severe renal, hepatic, myelogenous, and neurologic toxicities have been reported  . Germanium sesquioxide (Ge-132), an organic compound that is supposed to have lower toxicities, has been marketed as a dietary supplement to help fight cancers. In a single case study, tumor remission was reported following oral supplementation . However, there is no conclusive evidence showing this compound is an effective cancer treatment. A phase II clinical trial of germanium in reducing radiation-induced fatigue in cancer patients is underway \nThere are concerns of contamination of germanium products by the toxic inorganic germanium dioxide. The FDA has issued warning letters to marketers of germanium about unsubstantiated claims. Importation of germanium for human consumption is not allowed ",

      "How It Works": "The Gerson regimen does not treat or prevent cancer.\nThe Gerson regimen was developed by Max Gerson in the 1940s. It involves a strict metabolic diet that emphasizes fresh fruit and vegetable juice, high carbohydrate and potassium, no sodium or fat, and low animal protein. The diet is often supplemented with digestive enzymes, coffee enemas, and various supplements, including laetrile. This diet is based on the theory that it addresses the cause of cancer by detoxifying the body and stimulating metabolism so that the body can heal itself. These toxins, Gerson claimed, build up from environmental pollution and processed foods and eventually alter cell metabolism. However, this proposed toxin build-up has never been proven, nor has the diet’s ability to remove such toxins from the body.\nCoffee enemas are used in several metabolic therapies. Theoretically, coffee enemas might aid excretion from the liver and colon, but no theory has been proven. In addition, coffee enemas can be dangerous when used repeatedly, causing electrolyte imbalances in the blood and impaired nutrient absorption. Because the high levels of fruits and vegetables are eaten raw, they may not be absorbed as easily, especially in patients with GI cancers or chemotherapy-induced GI disorders.",

      "Clinical Summary": "Regimen developed by Max Gerson involving a strict metabolic diet, coffee enemas, and various supplements, including laetrile, which is illegal in the United States but available at clinics in Mexico and elsewhere. The diet emphasizes fresh fruit and vegetable juice, high carbohydrate and potassium, no sodium or fat, and low animal protein, and is sometimes supplemented with exogenous digestive enzymes. This regimen claims to address the cause of cancer by detoxifying the system and stimulating metabolism so that the body can heal itself Coffee enemas can cause infections, dangerous electrolyte deficiencies, and death . Despite proponents’ claims of recovery rates as high as 70-90 percent, case reviews by the NCI and New York County Medical Society in 1947 found no evidence of anticancer effects with the Gerson diet . The only large, retrospective review of patient survival in the literature was conducted by the Gerson Research Organization.\nThe American Cancer Society (ACS) warns that the Gerson method can be very harmful ",

      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "Gerson claims he originally developed the diet to treat his migraines, but found it a successful as a treatment for skin tuberculosis and stomach cancer . His therapy is based on the theory that cancer is caused by alteration of cell metabolism by toxic environmental substances and food processing, which changes the sodium and potassium content of foods. Gerson’s rationale is that cancer patients have low immunity and generalized tissue damage characterized by decreased intracellular potassium to sodium (K/Na) ratios, and, when their cancer is destroyed, toxic degradation products cause coma and death. His diet increases potassium intake and minimizes sodium consumption in an effort to correct the electrolyte imbalance, repair tissue, and detoxify the liver, while coffee enemas reportedly cause dilation of bile ducts and excretion of toxic breakdown products by the liver and through the colon wall. Supplemental potassium and oxidizing thyroid enzymes are given to introduce oxidation to cancer cells and kill them. None of these claims has been substantiated by scientific research \nThis regimen has resulted in coma-inducing low levels of sodium. Case reports of deaths from repeated administration of coffee enemas indicate that the practice causes a dangerous decrease in serum electrolytes. Coffee enemas have an osmolality of 62 mOsm/kg; repeated administration increases extravascular fluid volume and may cause electrolyte imbalances and subsequent death \nThe ease of absorption of the high volumes of raw fruit and vegetables in this diet is questionable, especially in patients with GI cancers or chemotherapy-induced mucosal damage. While elements of the Gerson diet are similar to diet recommendations made by the USDA and the American Cancer Society, metabolic diets are unsuitable for some patients with disseminated or metastatic disease, particularly of the head, neck, and gut ",
      "Adverse Reactions": "Common: Flu-like symptoms, loss of appetite, perspiration with foul odor, weakness, dizziness, cold sores, fever blisters, high fever, tumor pain, intestinal cramping, diarrhea, and vomiting. (The Gerson handbook claims that these adverse reactions are indicative of response) Common (metabolic diet): Nutrient deficiencies (calcium, vitamins D and B12, protein), anemia, and malabsorption may result from metabolic diets.Reported:Campylobacterfetus sepsis caused by the liver injections was reported in 13 patients using the Gerson therapy between 1980-6; liver injections were subsequently eliminated from the regimen. Coma from low serum sodium (as low as 102 mEq/l) occurred in 5 of these patients \nCoffee enemas cause electrolyte imbalance, which has resulted in serious infections, dehydration, colitis, constipation, and death.Case Reports (Coffee enemas): Case 1: Multiple seizures and hypokalemia leading to cardiorespiratory arrest, coma, and death were reported after excessive use of coffee enemas (1-4 per hour) for a number of days. Case 2: Death attributable to fluid and electrolyte imbalance causing pleural and pericardial effusions after use of coffee enemas, 4 per day for 8 weeks ",

      "Scientific Name": "Zingiber officinale, Zingiberis rhizoma",
      "Clinical Summary": "Derived from the rhizome of the plant, ginger is native to Asia and is used both as food and as medicine. In traditional Chinese medicine, ginger is used to expel “cold”, “wind” and “dampness”, and is believed to stop the reverse flow of Qi (energy) . Western use has been primarily for gastrointestinal symptoms and respiratory ailments. In vitro and animal studies suggest that ginger has antiemetic , anticancer , anti-inflammatory , anti-drug-dependence , and hypoglycemic effects . It may also protect against Alzheimer’s disease . Ginger influences gastric emptying in healthy individuals  and may promote feelings of satiety . Systematic reviews of ginger suggest effectiveness of ginger for treating primary dysmenorrhea  and moderate efficacy against osteoarthritic and chronic low back pain Although clinical trials indicate that ginger can effectively reduce nausea and vomiting,  it should be avoided perioperatively due to its anticoagulant/antiplatelet effects , and during pregnancy since animal studies highlight concerns regarding embryo development . Dietary ginger seems to be without these effects , although some studies suggest that high concentrations of fresh ginger have both antiplatelet  and antiviral  potential.The evidence for ginger in prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) is generally positive , although a systemic review of randomized controlled (RCTs) or crossover trials was unable to draw any conclusions ; aromatherapy using ginger was found ineffective in relieving CINV, but improvements were seen in quality of life . Another pilot study suggests that ginger supplementation may have chemopreventive effects for those at increased risk for colon cancer with normal-appearing colonic mucosa . More and larger studies are needed to confirm any true benefit with ginger supplementation for symptom control or chemoprevention.",

        "Spasms",
        "Stomach and intestinal gas"
      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "The antiemetic action of ginger is attributed to the rhizome constituents shogaol and gingerol, which stimulate the flow of saliva, bile, and gastric secretions, and galanolactone, which can act as a competitive antagonist at serotonin 5-HT3 receptors . Additional activities include the stimulation of antral contractions, reduction of postprandial antral area, and acceleration of gastric emptying . Ginger inhibits thromboxane formation and platelet aggregation . However, these effects appear to be dose- and formulation-dependent (e.g., dried, fresh, or extract) . In vitro studies suggest that fresh ginger stimulates mucosal cells to secrete IFN-β to combat viral infection , while certain ginger preparations have been shown to reduce lipopolysaccharide-induced secretion of IL-8 in human bronchial epithelial cells  and inhibit human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) and c-Myc expression in human lung cancer cells \nGingerol induces apoptosis of gastric cancer cells through TRAIL-dependent caspase 3/7 activation  and inhibits cell-cycle progression by reducing cyclin D1 expression . It also inhibits secretion of angiogenic cytokines such as VEGF and IL-8 in ovarian cancer cells . In animal models, shogaol reduces in vivo tumor growth by damaging microtubules and inducing mitotic arrest . Increased levels of circulating antioxidant and phase II enzymes, and reduced lipid peroxidation levels are also mechanisms by which ginger protects against DMH-induced colon cancers ",

      "How It Works": "Ginkgo does not improve memory or cognitive functioning in healthy people. It was also found ineffective in decreasing the occurrence of dementia or Alzheimer’s disease in elderly individuals.\nScientists have found that ginkgo dilates blood vessels in the brain in animals and humans, thereby increasing blood flow to the brain. This enables the body to handle ischemic (low oxygen) conditions, which can help prevent tissue damage. In animal studies, ginkgo showed a beneficial effect on smooth muscle tone found in arteries, maintaining their appropriate dilation and constriction. Experiments have also revealed that ginkgo can reduce inflammation and calm muscle spasms. As an antioxidant, it can also neutralize free radicals in the body, which cause cellular and DNA damage. Laboratory and animal experiments suggest that ginkgo can help prevent infections. Ginkgo also inhibits platelet-activating factor, which is important for blood clotting, and therefore has blood thinning qualities.Ginkgo supplementation may increase risk of stroke.",

      "Brand Name": "Ginkoba®",
      "Scientific Name": "Ginkgo biloba",
      "Clinical Summary": "Ginkgo biloba is one of the oldest living tree species. It is cultivated around the world for its medicinal properties and aesthetic value. The seeds and the leaves have been used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat respiratory diseases, circulatory disorders, sexual dysfunction, and loss of hearingGinkgo extracts exhibit anti-infective , chemopreventive , anticancer , and cytotoxic  effects in vitro. Supplementation with ginkgo improved cognitive performance in healthy adults , and in patients with dementia  although data are conflicting . In a study of older adults with normal cognition or with mild cognitive impairment , gingko did not slow down cognitive decline. And findings from the Gingko Evaluation of Memory (GEM) study, the largest trial of ginkgo for dementia to date, indicate that ginkgo is ineffective in decreasing the incidence of dementia or Alzheimer’s disease in elderly individuals ; another randomized trial reported similar findings . However, ginkgo may be effective as a short-term treatment to improve memory in Alzheimer’s patients, although taking ginkgo supplements regularly does not prevent dementia . In other studies, it was found less effective than standard treatment for ADHD in children Ginkgomay also reduce the severity of acute mountain sickness, but the evidence is mixed . More studies are warranted.Ginkgo’s anticancer potential  has been explored as well. It has been implicated in reducing the risk of ovarian cancer, although based only on epidemiological and biological data . Orally administered capsules ofginkgoexocarp polysaccharides reduced the tumor area in patients with gastric cancer . In another study, an injectable form of ginkgo extract and 5-flurouracil were administered to patients with advanced colorectal cancer. Data suggests benefits of the combination therapy . But data from the GEM study, in which cancer was the secondary outcome, do not support gingko’s effectiveness in reducing cancer risk . Ginkgo supplementation was also reported ineffective in preventing chemotherapy-associated cognitive dysfunction in a randomized controlled trial of breast cancer patients \nInterestingly, high doses of aginkgoextract showed carcinogenic effects in a murine model . However, dietary supplements in use today have much smaller concentrations of ginkgo.",
      "Purported Uses2": [
        "Asthma",
        "Bronchitis",

        "Stress",
        "Tinnitus"
      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "Ginkgo interacts with several cytochrome P450 enzymes. Pretreatment with G. biloba extract was shown to induce the expression of CYP3A protein and mRNA, and increased CYP3A activity . It also inhibits CYP2B6 catalytic activity and bupropion hydroxylation . In other studies, ginkgo was shown to play a role in decreasing high-glucose-induced endothelial inflammation via inhibition of interleukin-6 activation , and repeated intake of Ginkgo enhanced cell proliferation and neuroblast differentiation . The flavonoids present in ginkgo extracts were found to inhibit estrogen biosynthesis via aromatase inhibition, decrease CYP19 mRNA, and induce transcriptional suppression. These findings suggest a role for ginkgo as an adjuvant treatment for breast cancer The present study demonstrated that three flavonoids synergistically inhibit estrogen biosynthesis through aromatase inhibition, decrease CYP19 mRNA, and induce transcriptional suppression. Our results support the usefulness of flavonoids in adjuvant therapy for breast cancer by reducing estrogen levels with reduced adverse effects due to estrogen depletionThe chemopreventive ability of bilobalide, a terpene trilactone, is thought to be via alterations in cryptal cell proliferation and drug-metabolizing enzyme activities . The exocarp polysaccharides fromginkgowere shown to affect the expression of c-myc, bcl-2 and c-fos genes, which can inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis and differentiation of human gastric tumor cells ",
      "Warnings": "G. biloba extracts should not contain ginkgolic acid.\nDiscontinue use of ginkgo at least 36 hours before surgery.",

      "How It Works": "American ginseng has not been shown to treat or prevent cancer.\nAmerican ginseng has been shown to lower blood sugar levels in humans. Scientists think that the medicinal properties of this herb come from its components called ginsenosides. Most research has been done on another species, Panax ginseng. These studies indicate that ginsenosides both stimulate and inhibit the central nervous system in humans and stimulate the immune system in mice.\nAmerican ginseng was shown to reduce the number and severity of colds, and improve working memory in healthy adults. It also showed anticancer properties in lab studies, and may be useful in reducing cancer-related fatigue.American ginseng decreases the anticoagulant effects of warfarin, a commonly used anticoagulant. Also, breast cancer patients should use this herb with caution because it can stimulate the growth of breast cancer cells.",

American ginseng is also used in supplemental form to improve athletic performance, strength and stamina, and to treat diabetes and cancer. The saponin glycosides, also known as ginsenosides or panaxosides, are thought responsible for the herb’s biological effects. Ginsenosides have both stimulatory and inhibitory effects on the CNS , alter cardiovascular tone, enhance humoral and cellular-dependent immunity, and exert anticancer effects \nCurrent data suggest that American ginseng may improve glucose control in diabetics , and that it is safe for long-term use . It also demonstrated a modest effect in reducing the number and severity of colds ; enhanced working memory in young  and middle aged  healthy adults, as well as in patients with schizophrenia \nThe anticancer activity of American ginseng was enhanced when combined with antioxidants . In other studies, the herb showed synergistic effects with 5-fluorouracil against colorectal cancer cells ; and conferred protection against oxidative stress in irradiated human lymphocytes \nData from an epidemiological study indicate that American ginseng improves survival and quality of life in breast cancer patients . Findings from a randomized controlled trial support its benefits in improving cancer-related fatigue ",
      "Purported Uses2": [
        "Cancer prevention",
        "Cancer treatment",
        "Diabetes",
        "Health maintenance",
        "Immunostimulation",
        "Strength and stamina"
      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "Ginsenosides are thought responsible for American ginseng’s activity, although the exact mechanism of action is unknown. Related species, such as Panax ginseng, have been the focus of most laboratory and clinical research. Experiments using extracts from these species indicate that ginsenosides stimulate and inhibit the CNS . The extracts also stimulate TNF alpha production by alveolar macrophages The Rg1 ginsenoside present in American ginseng is associated with improvements in humoral and cell-mediated immune response and increases in T helper cells, T lymphocytes, and NK cells in mice . American ginseng was also shown to lower serum glucose and may affect carbohydrate metabolism \nSeveral ginsenosides demonstrated anticancer properties in vitro  . Current data suggest that the antiproliferative effects of American ginseng are due to compound K, a metabolite of the ginsenoside Rb1, but not Rb1 as previously thought . In another study, the herb was shown to significantly attenuate azoxymethane/dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colon carcinogenesis by reducing the colon tumor number and tumor load, associated with suppression of DSS-induced proinflammatory cytokine activation ",
      "Contraindications": "Breast cancer patients should use this product with caution as American ginseng may stimulate the growth of breast cancer cells ",
      "Herb-Drug Interactions": "Warfarin: American ginseng has been shown to antagonize warfarin’s effects Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 substrates: Certain ginsenosides can induce CYP3A4 and may affect the metabolism of drugs that are substrates of this enzyme  ",

      "How It Works": "Panax ginseng may be effective in treating erectile dysfunction and diabetes. Whether it can improve strength and stamina remains unknown.\nAlthough extensive research has been performed with Panax ginseng showing that it exhibits a wide range of biological activities, scientists are still not exactly sure how it works. The active ingredients are called ginsenosides. These substances show definite activity in the nervous systems of animals, with both stimulatory and inhibitory effects.\nCertain ginsenosides are able to stimulate the immune system in mice. Ginsenosides may also have anti-cancer activity: when they are directly applied to melanoma cells in the laboratory, these cells stop growing and multiplying. In addition, ginseng can prevent some tumors in mice, including ovarian, lung, liver, and skin cancers. Some studies suggest that this effect may also occur in humans: in one study, Korean individuals who consumed ginseng extract had a decreased risk of all types of cancers.\nOther experiments have suggested that ginseng may increase the production of nitric oxide, a vasodilator, in the heart, lung, and kidneys. In addition, studies in animals showed that ginseg can lower blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels. In humans, clinical trials suggest that ginseng can reduce muscle injury and inflammation after exercise.",

      "Brand Name": "Ginsana®, G115®, Ginsai®",
      "Scientific Name": "Panax ginseng",
      "Clinical Summary": "Panax ginseng is an herb native to East Asia and Russia, also cultivated for its medicinal properties. The root is widely used as a “Yang” tonic in traditional medicine . Patients take ginseng to improve athletic performance, strength and stamina, and as an immunostimulant. Some use it to treat diabetes, cancer, HIV/AIDS, and a variety of other conditions.Ginsenosides, the saponin glycosides, are thought responsible for Panax ginseng’s medicinal effects. Ginsenosides have both stimulatory and inhibitory effects on the CNS, alter cardiovascular tone, and increase humoral and cellular-dependent immunity Ginseng has been used in the treatment of erectile dysfunction . It may increase the hypoglycemic effects of insulin and sulfonylureas as well as reduce insulin resistance in type II diabetic patients , and enhance immune response . It was also shown to improve menopausal symptoms, and may positively affect cardiovascular health in postmenopausal women . Data from randomized clinical trials indicate that ginseng helps alleviate idiopathic chronic fatigue , and may alleviate cold hypersensitivity of hands and feet in women \nGinseng also has anticancer potential. In vitro studies indicate that ginsenosides have antiproliferative effects . Data from epidemiological studies show improved survival and quality of life with ginseng use, in breast cancer patients ; and inverse association between ginseng consumption and reduction in the risk of endometrial cancer in breast cancer survivors . In addition, two case-controlled studies of Korean subject indicate an association between consumption of a Panax ginseng extract with reduction in the incidence of all cancers . Larger, well-designed studies are needed.\nBecause ginseng was shown to have estrogenic effects , patients with hormone-sensitive cancers should avoid it until definitive data are available. Panax ginseng should not be confused with American ginseng or Siberian ginseng, which have different medicinal properties.",
      "Purported Uses2": [
        "Angina",
        "Diabetes",
        "Health maintenance",
        "AIDS",

        "Pain",
        "Sexual dysfunction",
        "Strength and stamina"
      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "Ginsenosides have been shown responsible for many of ginseng’s effects, including analgesic effects when administered parenterally . Animal studies suggest that the ginsenoside Rb1 improves the release of acetylcholine and enhances post-synaptic uptake of choline . Ginsenosides also compete for binding sites on GABA receptors in vitro. They prolong drug-induced sleeping time in mice and exhibit additional depressant effects on the central nervous system . Ginseng may improve nitric oxide synthesis in endothelium of the heart, lung, kidneys, and in the corpus cavernosum Oral intake of ginseng was shown to reduce muscle injury and inflammation following exercise in humans, marked by reductions in the levels of creatine kinase, beta-glucuronidase, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) . In animal studies, ginseng saponins lowered total plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels \nAnticancer activity has also been observed in vitro with several ginsenosides. Differentiation of HL-60 (promyelocytic cells) was induced in ginsenosides Rh2- and Rh3-treated cells ; Rg3 exerts its effects in part by blocking the nuclear translocation of the protein ß-catenin in colon cancer cells, most of which turn cancerous via activation of the Wnt/ß-catenin signaling pathway ; Rp1 reduces breast cancer cell proliferation by decreasing the stability of the insulin like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) protein in breast cancer cells ",
      "Warnings": "Ginseng use should be discontinued at least one week before surgery ",
      "Contraindications": "Panax ginseng has estrogenic activity. Patients with hormone-sensitive cancer should avoid taking it ",
      "Adverse Reactions": [
        "Dry mouth, tachycardia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, insomnia, and nervousnesshave been reported following consumption of ginseng",
        "A 26-year-old male with no history of mental illness became manic following chronic consumption of 250 mg panax ginseng capsules three times a day. His symptoms, including irritability, insomnia, flight of ideas, and rapid speech, resolved following discontinuation of supplement",

        "A 46-year-old woman developed orobuccolingual dyskinesia (OBLD) that interfered with her speech, tongue-biting and eating difficulties, following consumption of a formula containing black cohosh and ginseng. Her symptoms resolved after discontinuing use of the formula",
        "Two cases of ginseng-associated manic psychosis have been reported",
        "Pulmonary embolism has been reported in a 41-year-old woman after taking panax pills"
      ],
      "Herb-Drug Interactions": "Insulin and sulfonylureas:P. ginseng may increase the hypoglycemic effect of insulin and sulfonylureas Anticoagulants:P. ginseng may antagonize the effects of anticoagulants Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs):P. ginseng may cause manic-like symptoms when combined with MAOIs Imatinib:P. ginseng may increase risk of hepatotoxicity Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 substrates: Certain ginsenosides can induce CYP3A4 and may increase the clearance of substrate drugs .

      "How It Works": "There is no scientific evidence to support the traditional uses of Glehnia.\nScientists do not know how glehnia works. Very little laboratory research has been done with this herb, which is often used in traditional Chinese medicine. Some lab studies show that glehnia stimulates the heart’s ability to contract, has antibacterial effects, and works as a topical pain killer in mice. It is not known if these effects occur in the human body.",
      "Purported Uses": [
        [
          "To treat bronchitis and relieve chest congestion",

      "Clinical Summary": "Derived from the root of the plant, glehnia is used in traditional medicine to treat bronchitis and whooping cough. It is also used in Asia to treat immune-related diseases. Studies indicate anti-inflammatory  and antitumor properties . Clinical trials have not been conducted.Theoretically, glehnia may have additive effects with anticoagulant and antiplatelet agents due to the coumarin component. Additional research is necessary to determine the safety and efficacy of this botanical.",
      "Purported Uses2": [
        "Bronchitis",
        "Chest congestion",
        "Whooping cough"
      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "It has been reported that glehnia root can hemolyze blood cells, stimulate myocardial contractility, and exert antibacterial effects . Studies in mice demonstrated analgesic effects of glehnia root extracts ; and intraperitoneal injection of a glehnia extract was found to inhibit topical edema and substantially reduced inflammatory damage, vascular permeability, cytokine production, and neutrophil-mediated myeloperoxidase activity . The anti-inflammatory properties of glehnia may be due to the inhibition of proinflammatory mediators, such as nitric oxide, prostaglandin E2, tumor necrosis factor, and interleukin 1-beta, via suppression of NF-kappaB- and mitogen-activated protein kinases-dependent pathways . Imperatorin, a compound isolated from glehnia roots, blocks the protein expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages significantly Polyacetylenic compounds extracted from glehnia fruit may have antiproliferative activity against human gastric adenocarcinoma, (MK-1), human uterine carcinoma (HeLa), and murine malignant melanoma (B16F10) cancer cell lines ",
      "Contraindications": "Due to the psoralen content, patients receiving radiation therapy should not consume this herb.",
      "Adverse Reactions": "No adverse reactions have been reported, but photosensitivity may occur due to psoralens.",

      "Scientific Name": "2-Amino-2-deoxyglucose",
      "Clinical Summary": "Glucosamine is an endogenous aminomonosaccharide synthesized from glucose. Found in mucopolysaccharides, mucoproteins and chitin, a cellulose-like biopolymer in marine invertebrate exoskeletons, it is used in the biosynthesis of proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans, sugar-protein molecules found in cartilage. Glucosamine also has anti-inflammatory activity. Both oral and injectable forms have been studied for osteoarthritis. Glucosamine is marketed as a dietary supplement and often paired with chondroitin sulfate for joint health.In earlier studies, glucosamine and chondroitin reduced degenerative and temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disease symptoms . Although glucosamine/chondroitin supplementation was comparable to celecoxib in a large multicenter trial of patients with severe knee osteoarthritis (OA) pain , other studies have not found benefit with glucosamine, chondroitin, or the combination for knee or hip OA . Data on chondroitin alone also suggest no significant benefit . In addition, no efficacy was seen with glucosamine in relieving back pain , degenerative lumbar OA , or improving glucose metabolism in type 2 diabetes . Any benefits with glucosamine may be limited to older patients who have arthritis that is more severe  or for longer periods of time Epidemiological studies suggest potential reduction for some cancer risks and mortality with long-term glucosamine/chondroitin supplementation, although limitations such as bias could not be ruled out and confirmatory studies are needed There are case reports of liver injury/toxicity related to glucosamine consumption . Patients on antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapies should be monitored for interactions or increased INR levels . Patients with poorly controlled diabetes or glucose intolerance should be monitored as glucosamine could worsen insulin resistance ",

        "Osteoarthritis",
        "Temporomandibular joint disorder (TMJ)"
      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "Progressive degeneration of cartilage glycosaminoglycans is evident in osteoarthritis. Glucosamine is the first step in glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis. In vitro, it increased production of monomeric proteoglycans capable of assembling into high molecular weight aggregates . Glucosamine can protect cartilage from metabolic impairment by NSAIDs, corticosteroids, and by exerting anti-inflammatory effects . Glucosamine can promote cartilage repair by inducing tissue TGFβ1 and CTGF expression that regulates chondrocyte proliferation The rise in intraocular pressure associated with older patients in one study may relate to exogenous glycosaminoglycans (GAG) effects on accumulations of extracellular matrix and thickening of the basement membrane, thereby compromising function of the trabecular meshwork . Reduced systemic inflammation and cytokine activity found in a small randomized crossover study may explain potential reductions in mortality or cancer risk Glucosamine is slow to act  but the effects persist after cessation of treatment ",

      "How It Works": "Glutamine may be helpful for preventing some symptoms related to cancer treatments, such as oral inflammation. Combined with other nutrients, it can prevent muscle wasting and weight loss in patients with advanced cancer and HIV, but more research is needed.\nGlutamine is the most abundant amino acid in the human body. It is made by most body tissues and is also found in foods such as wheat, corn, barley, peanuts, soybeans, and milk. Glutamine is important for several bodily functions, like acting as building blocks for protein. When the body is malnourished or breaks down its own muscle protein, known as cachexia, taking extra glutamine can help restore body levels and prevent adverse health effects. For example, glutamine is the major fuel source of cells that line the intestinal tract, and is therefore important in maintaining GI function. It is also the major fuel source for certain cells used in the body’s immune defense. It removes excess toxic ammonia from the body and synthesizes glutathione to help detoxify foreign substances in the liver.\nGlutamine may help treat cachexia (muscle wasting)in patients with advanced cancer and AIDS and prevent oral mucositis (inflammation) related to certain cancer treatments. Initial studies also suggest it may help chemotherapy-related nerve pain. Larger well-designed trials are needed to confirm these effects.",

      "Side Effects": "Studies in cancer patients suggest oral glutamine is well tolerated. However, other studies using specific oral preparations reported adverse events including swelling, gastrointestinal symptoms, heachache, fever, and infections.",
      "Special Point": "Although related, glutamine should not be confused with another amino acid known as glutamate.",
      "Clinical Summary": "Glutamine is an amino acid that can be absorbed from food sources and synthesized and stored, mainly in the muscle and the lungs. It is the building block of protein and a major cellular fuel source. Although abundant in the body, patients with cancer and HIV/AIDS-related cachexia or recovering from catabolic states such as surgery, sepsis, and intense exercise may need to increase intake. Parenteral supplementations are used in hospitals but oral formulations are available in medical foods. Glutamine is also marketed as a dietary supplement to enhance muscle building, wound healing, and for intestinal and immune system health.Glutamine improves nitrogen balance, preserves intestinal integrity , maintains intracellular glutamine levels, and reduces hospital stay in post-surgical or critically ill patients , but has no effects on preventing new infections . Perioperative intravenous glutamine restored disturbed renal arginine synthesis that occurred from abdominal aortic surgery . When used in total parenteral nutrition, glutamine improved nutritional status and reduced mortality and complications , but effects on infants with gastrointestinal disease are minimal The benefits of glutamine in cancer care have been examined in clinical studies for cachexia , peripheral neuropathy , mucositis , and gastrointestinal toxicity . Intravenous glutamine significantly reduced chemotherapy-induced nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea in patients with gastric or colorectal cancer . An RCT suggests enteral nutrition that includes arginine , glutamine, and omega-3 fatty acids may improve short-term survival in stage IV gastric cancer patients . It was also effective against radiation morbidity in breast cancer patients . Conclusions from a meta-analysis indicate glutamine reduces duration but not severity of diarrhea . However, conflicting data indicate that perioperative glutamine did not have an influence on post-surgical complications or infection in gastrointestinal cancer patients . Furthermore, recent findings suggest a role in tumor cell growth and maintenance . More research is needed to resolve the ambiguity.In an RCT of the glycemic effects of glutamine, modest decreases in concentrations of circulating blood cells, total protein, and albumin were observed ",

      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "Glutamine is essential for the maintenance of intestinal mucosal integrity and function . It maintains immune function by serving as the principle metabolic fuel for cells, acts as a precursor for protein synthesis, and along with cysteine and glycine, is involved in glutathione (GSH) synthesis. Intravenous glutamine preserves liver and intestinal glutathione stores in animal models of oxidant damage. Glutamine is also involved in nitrogen exchange, as it neutralizes and eliminates excess ammonia formed during protein catabolism. As a nitrogen donor, it contributes to the synthesis of other non-essential amino acids, including the purines and pyrimidines, and is therefore essential for the proliferation of most cells . It also plays a supportive role during biochemical stress and sepsis. Although the mechanism in treatment of cachexia is unclear, it is thought that glutamine, a modulator of protein turnover, enhances net protein synthesis . Clinical evidence suggests that total parenteral nutrition supplemented with glutamine improves nitrogen balance, maintains the intracellular glutamine pool, enhances protein synthesis, and prevents deterioration of gut permeability in post-surgery patients Glutamine prevented genotoxic and clastogenic damages caused by cisplatin in mice . Glutamine may potentiate the tumoricidal effect of methotrexate (MTX) since polyglutamation of MTX impairs its efflux from tumor cells and may reduce its accumulation in the gut . The supplemental intravenous form leads to increases of GSH in the gut, but not in tumors, in a sarcoma-bearing rat model.However, recent findings show that glutamine transporters are upregulated in tumor cells and that glutamine acts as a mitochondrial substrate and promotes protein translation. This indicates tumor cell dependence for growth and maintenance . And a recent study demonstrated that glutamine helps cancer cells survive acidic stress, rather than provide nutrition, through enzymatic deamidation ",
      "Adverse Reactions": "Studies in cancer patients suggest oral glutamine is well tolerated . However, other studies using specific oral preparations reported adverse events including peripheral edema, gastrointestinal symptoms, heachache, fever, and infections ",
      "Herb-Drug Interactions": "Lactulose: Glutamine may reduce the ammonia-lowering effect of lactulose . This interaction does not apply when lactulose is used as a laxative.Methotrexate: Glutamine may preferentially increase tumor retention of MTX, thereby increasing its therapeutic efficacy ",

One in vitro study found that berberine inhibited the growth of adherent and anoikis resistant MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells to a greater extent than doxorubicin . In one study, berberine alkaloids produced an average of 91% tumor inhibition against 6 malignant brain tumor cell lines both in vivo in mice and in vitro against human brain tumors . Berberine alkaloids were also shown to have potent macrophage-activating and cytostatic activity against tumor cells. Another study performed in vitro tests on a series of human malignant brain tumor cells and rat brain tumor cells . Berberine used alone at a dose of 150 mcg/ml had an average cancer cell kill rate of 91%. BCNU (carmustine) had a cell kill rate of 43%. Rats treated with berberine at 10 mg/kg had an 81% kill rate. The combination of both berberine and BCNU had additive effects in killing cancer cells.In an animal study, berberine has been shown to prolong QTc interval and to help prevent ventricular fibrillation after myocardial infarction .

Although this botanical has been studied extensively in the laboratory, very few studies have been conducted in humans. Laboratory studies have found a range of effects including improved wound healing and anti-inflammatory effects. Studies in humans have suggested that gotu kola can decrease venous pressure in people with venous insufficiency and may be able to relieve anxiety.",

      ],
      "Scientific Name": "Centella asiatica, Hydrocotyle asiatica",
      "Clinical Summary": "Gotu kola is an evergreen perennial plant that is prevalent in East Asia and many parts of South Africa. Extracts from the leaf and the whole plant are used for a variety of conditions including venous insufficiency, varicose veins, wound healing, scleroderma, and scars. In vitro and in vivo analyses indicate that gotu kola has neuroprotective  and chemopreventive  properties, and also protects against cognitive impairment . Madecassoside, an active constituent, was shown effective against arthritis  and myocardial infarction \nTopical application of an asiaticoside extracted from gotu kola enhanced burn wound healing , and an herbal preparation containing gotu kola was shown to benefit those with chronic periodontitis . Supplementation with gotu kola improved cognitive function and mood in the elderly , alleviated generalized anxiety disorder  and may help wound healing in diabetic patients \nData also show a reduction in lower extremity edema with gotu kola compared to placebo in patients with chronic venous insufficiency \nGotu kola should not be confused with kolanut. Gotu kola does not contain any caffeine and has not been shown to have stimulant properties.",

        "Sedation",
        "Varicose veins"
      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "The triterpenoids are considered to be the active constituents in gotu kola. Asiaticoside, a triterpenoid, demonstrates anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting  lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced fever and inflammatory response, including production of serum tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-6 , prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2), liver myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, and expression of brain cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) protein . Asiaticoside also promotes wound healing by stimulating collagen and glycosaminoglycan synthesis, and angiogenesis .  Another study showed that a gotu kola extract may regulate stress-induced premature senescence (SIPS) by preventing repression of DNA replication and mitosis-related gene expression A water extract of gotu kola prevented the formation of intracellular beta-amyloid aggregates in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease with high amounts of beta-amyloid . There is also preliminary evidence that gotu kola might have sedative and analgesic properties ",

Traditionally, grape seed oil and grape seed extract (GSE) have been used as a laxative, antacid, cholagogic agent, to treat burns, ulcers, and as a hand cleanser . Studies of grape seed proanthocyanidin extract (GSPE) in mice have shown effectiveness in minimizing cardiotoxicity induced by doxorubicin  , cyclosporine ; and drug-induced nephro- and pulmonary toxicities . GSPE also inhibits atherosclerosis Small human studies have shown possible efficacy in decreasing LDL  and increasing total serum antioxidant activity . Conclusions from a meta analysis indicate that grape seed extract significantly lowers systolic blood pressure and heart rate, but does not affect lipid or CRP levels \nTopical application of GSPE has been shown to accelerate wound contraction and closure \nIn vitro studies have shown GSPE to have anticancer effects  and synergistic effects with doxorubicin . Supplementation with grape seed may be associated with decreased risk of hematologic malignancies .

      "How It Works": "Graviola showed anticancer effects in lab studies. Human data are lacking.Extracts of graviola have been shown to be effective against a number of viruses, bacteria, and parasites in test tubes. Laboratory studies have also shown graviola to be effective against some types of cancer cells. It contains chemicals called acetogenins, which are thought to be the active ingredient. However, substances derived from graviola can damage nerve cells and cause neurological side effects similar to Parkinson’s disease. In addition, some animal studies suggest long-term use may increase the risk of other neurological diseases. Graviola may also affect nuclear imaging because it has been shown to decrease the uptake of radiopharmaceuticals used in such procedures.",

      "Scientific Name": "Annona muricata",
      "Clinical Summary": "Graviola is a tree prevalent in the rain forests of Africa, South America, and Southeast Asia. The fruits, also known as soursop, are consumed as food. The leaves and stems are used in traditional medicine for symptoms associated with inflammation and infection. Graviola is also available as a dietary supplement and widely promoted as an alternative treatment for cancer, although clinical evidence is lacking. In some Caribbean countries, it is among the most common herbal remedies used in among prostate, breast and colorectal cancer patients Many of the health benefits from graviola are thought to be derived from its antioxidant properties . In animal studies, extracts from graviola leaves showed anti-inflammatory , analgesic , antidiabetic , antiulcer , and antiviral  effects. The leaf extracts also have antimicrobial activities . Graviola extracts from the leaf, fruit, and seed have been tested in laboratories for their anticancer effects. Some studies show these extracts to be active against breast , lung , colon , prostate , pancreas , liver , and skin cancer  cell lines. However, graviola products have not been studied in cancer patients.Consumption of graviola has been associated with adverse effects. Alkaloids extracted from graviola may cause neuronal dysfunction and degeneration leading to symptoms of Parkinson’s disease . Some animal models also suggest that long-term ingestion of graviola juice may accelerate neurodegenerative diseases . Graviola may decrease the uptake of radiopharmaceuticals used in nuclear imaging  and lower platelet counts ",

      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "Annonaceous acetogenins, phytochemicals isolated from the leaves, bark, and twigs, are thought to be the active ingredients of graviola. An ethanolic extract of A. muricata shows in vitro antiviral activity against the Herpes simplex virus , and antimicrobial activity against Leishmania Alkaloids from graviola are detrimental to the survival of dopaminergic nerve cells in vitro. This may result in neuronal dysfunction and degeneration. Graviola-induced cell death was inhibited by glucose supplementation suggesting that cell death may have been caused by energy depletion . Graviola has also been shown to stimulate serotonin receptors . An ethanolic extract produced cell-stimulating behaviors either by increased mitochondrial turnover indicating stimulation in protein production or by preparation to leave the G1 phase, perhaps due to promitotic stimulus present within the extract which acts like a growth factor In animal models, antidiabetic effects are due to antioxidant, hypolipidemic, and protective effects in pancreatic beta-cells, which improves glucose metabolism . Graviola extract demonstrated antiulcer effects by increasing nitric oxide and prostaglandin E2 activities . Graviola fruit extract has anti-inflammatory and analgesic actions by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and COX-2 and by blocking opioid receptors . However, other animal studies suggest that long-term ingestion of graviola juice promotes generation of reactive nitrogen species that may accelerate development of neurodegenerative diseases involving the microtubule-associated protein tau Graviola extracts were effective against adriamycin-resistant human mammary adenocarcinoma (MCF-7/Adr) by blocking access of cancer cells to ATP and by inhibiting the actions of plasma membrane glycoprotein . They also inhibited expression of HIF-1α, NF-κB, glucose transporters, and glycolytic enzymes resulting in decreased glucose uptake and ATP production in pancreatic cancer cells , and downregulated EGFR expression in breast cancer cells . Phenolic compounds in graviola demonstrate free-radical scavenging potential against human breast carcinoma cells  and in promyelocytic leukemia cells . Extracts of acetogenin muricins J, K, and L have antiproliferative effects against human prostate cancer cells, with the effect of muricin K being strongest . In colon and in lung cancer cell lines, the ethanolic extract of graviola caused G1 cell-cycle arrest by upregulating Bax and downregulating Bcl-2 proteins . In rodent models of hepatic cancer, although constituents of graviola led to reduced tumor growth, the acetogenin bullatacin caused liver and kidney toxicity via increasing calcium concentration, ROS production, and Bax expression and Bax/Bcl-2 ratio with repeated treatment ",

      "How It Works": "Green tea may help lower cholesterol. Evidence of its cancer preventive effects in humans is not conclusive.\nGreen tea contains substances called polyphenols, which scientists think contribute to its anti-cancer activity. Laboratory studies of one polyphenol, catechin epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), show that it may interfere with several of the processes involved in cell replication, causing tumor cell death (apoptosis). It also might slow the formation of blood vessels around tumors. Epigallocatechin (ECG), another polyphenol, stops leukemic cells from multiplying in laboratory studies. As a proven antioxidant, green tea may repair cell damage, but whether it can prevent cancer is uncertain. It is also unknown how it might help protect the heart, but it reduces LDL (“bad”) cholesterol and increases HDL (“good”) cholesterol. Tannins present in green tea generally have antibacterial properties.Animal studies indicate that oral consumption of green tea extract during fasting can increase the risk of toxicity. Human studies are needed.",

      ],
      "Scientific Name": "Camellia sinensis",
      "Clinical Summary": "Green tea, a common beverage consumed in Asia, has been used to prevent and treat hyperlipidemia, hypertension, atherosclerosis and cancer. The active constituent is epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), which accounts for 40% of the total polyphenol content. Regular consumption may reduce the risk of hypertension  and positively affect mood . It may also enhance glucose tolerance in healthy individuals , but does not improve insulin sensitivity or glycemic control in overweight or obese males  or in individuals with type II diabetes . A decaffeinated extract was not associated with overall reductions in adiposity or improvements in BMD in overweight/obese postmenopausal women, but reduced tissue and gynoid fat in those with higher BMI . It may also reduce mortality due to cardiovascular disease in both men and women  and a theaflavin-enriched extract lowered the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level Topical application of green tea extracts is effective against external genital and perianal warts . One such extracts, sinecatechin, is an FDA-approved drug indicated for this use.Studies of chemopreventive activity of green tea indicate positive results . EGCG has been shown to modulate vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) leading to apoptosis in leukemic cells  and a green tea extract may benefit patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia . In a population at high-risk for hepatocellular carcinoma, green tea polyphenols were found to mitigate fumonisin biomarkers . Data are not conclusive on whether consumption of green tea reduces the risk of colorectal and stomach cancers in women ; there was no association between green tea and the risk of developing malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma ; another finding suggests that consumption may increase the risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women . But in patients who underwent total removal of colorectal adenomas by endoscopic polypectomy, supplementation with green tea extract was shown to prevent metachronous colorectal adenomas . Green tea consumption may also reduce the risk of myelodysplastic syndromes ; and supplementation with a blend of green tea, pomegranate, broccoli and curcumin resulted in a reduction in the rate of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) increase among men with prostate cancer following a PSA relapse post-radical treatment . However, supplementation with EGCG did not reduce the likelihood of prostate cancer The caffeinated form may cause insomnia and nausea. Use of decaffeinated products may be preferred due to lower incidence of adverse events, but data are inconsistent regarding the relative efficacy of caffeinated versus decaffeinated teas.  Patients undergoing chemotherapy should avoid consumption. Animal studies indicate that oral consumption of green tea extract during fasting can increase the risk of toxicity . In humans, daily intake of 300 mg of EGCG is proposed as tolerable  based on clinical data, whereas a daily dose amounting to 800 mg EGCG has been associated with elevated liver enzymes, which was reversible with cessation of consumption ",

      "Mechanism of Action": "Green tea is thought to confer cardiovascular protection by increasing HDL cholesterol, decreasing LDL cholesterol and triglycerides , as well as by blocking platelet aggregation. The tannins may have antibacterial properties  and can produce anti-diarrheal effects. The flavonoid constituents may reduce lipoprotein oxidation . Caffeine has stimulatory effects and is responsible for the majority of adverse effects and drug interactions. It is unknown whether removing caffeine alters green tea’s activities The mechanism by which green tea influences blood pressure is thought to be mediated through the catechin, epigallocatechin-3-gallate’s (EGCG) modulation of vascular constriction. EGCG induces nitric oxide (NO) production through the activation of endothelial NO synthase, resulting in vasodilation . In a recent study, green tea extract was shown to modulate effective brain connectivity during working memory processing in healthy subjects . EGCG was found to inhibit aggregation of tau protein, thereby reducing toxicity in neuronal model cells \nThe anticancer activity is thought to be related to polyphenol content with the chemopreventive attributes associated with EGCG, which is thought to induce apoptosis and tumor antiangiogenesis . EGCG may inhibit enzymes involved in cell replication and DNA synthesis by interfering with cell-to-cell adhesion or via inhibition of intracellular communication pathways required for cell division . In vitro data indicate that concentrations of 30 mcg/mL EGCG and (-)-epigallocatechin (EGC) inhibit lipoxygenase-dependent arachidonic acid metabolism by 30-75% in normal human colon mucosa and colon cancers . Other studies in human colon cancer cell lines suggest that EGCG inhibits topoisomerase I, but not topoisomerase II . EGCG also inhibits DNA replication in vitro in leukemia cancer cell lines . EGCG has been shown to modulate vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) leading to apoptosis in leukemic cells Administration of green tea inhibits UVB light-induced carcinogenesis , and when given before and during carcinogen treatment, reduces the incidence and number of stomach and esophageal tumors in mice . Topical EGCG may be useful as chemoprevention for skin cancer, but additional research and formulation are necessary ",

      "How It Works": "Guarana contains caffeine, and therefore has stimulant effects. Long-term effects of using guarana are not known.\nGuarana is extracted from the seed and gum of a plant found in the Amazon Basin. It is commonly used in beverages because of its flavor and because it contains high levels of caffeine. Scientists are very familiar with how caffeine affects the body: it prolongs the action of the sympathetic nervous system (responsible for our “fight or flight” response) and therefore stimulates the brain, heart and muscles, and increases blood pressure.Guarana showed anticancer, neuroprotective, and anti-anxiety properties in lab studies. A population study showed that guarana intake protected elderly subjects against metabolic disorders. A few small studies in cancer patients suggest guarana may help reduce chemotherapy-related fatigue, stabilize weight, and increase appetite. However, it did not reduce fatigue after radiation therapy, or in patients with head and neck cancers, and some symptoms worsened compared with a placebo. Further research is needed.",

      "Clinical Summary": "Guarana, a bushy plant prevalent in the Amazon Basin, has been used in traditional medicine to treat fevers, headaches, and dysentery. Actions of guarana are attributed primarily to caffeine present in its seeds . It is promoted as an appetite suppressant, stimulant, as an aphrodisiac, and to alleviate fatigue. There are extensive data regarding caffeine and its activity.\nIn vitro studies indicate that guarana has chemopreventive , neuroprotective,  and anxiolytic  properties. Epidemiologic data suggest its protective effects against metabolic disorders in elderly populations . Improvements in cognitive performance and mental fatigue were also observed following supplementation withguarana in healthy adults \nA few small studies in cancer patients suggest guarana may help reduce chemotherapy-related fatigue, stabilize weight, and increase appetite . However, it did not reduce fatigue post-radiation  or in patients with head and neck cancers, and some symptoms worsened compared with a placebo . Further research is needed.",

        "Central nervous system stimulation",
        "Fatigue",
        "Sexual performance"
      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "Many of guarana’s effects are thought to be due to its high caffeine content. Caffeine’s actions include CNS stimulation, cardiac stimulation, diuresis, increase in blood pressure, inhibition of platelet aggregation, skeletal muscle stimulation and causing hyperglycemia . Guarana demonstrated antioxidant effects by inhibiting lipid peroxidation . Chronic exposure to Guarana seed extract produced an anxiolytic effect involving the dopaminergic and serotonergic neurotransmission systems ",

      "Clinical Summary": "Guggul is derived from the resin of a medicinal plant that has been used for thousands of years in Ayurveda. Extracts of the plant are traditionally used alone and in combination with other botanicals to treat various clinical disorders including rheumatism, arthritis, neurological diseases, hemorrhoids, urinary disorders, and skin diseases.\nRecent interest to determine the ability of guggul to treat obesity and related disorders of lipid metabolism has led to many studies.\nGuggul was shown to protect against isoprenaline-induced cardiotoxicity in a study of rats . Results from clinical trials suggest comparable effectiveness of guggul to Clofibrate in reducing cholesterol and total lipid count ; but one trial showed that guggul may actually raise cholesterol levels . However, conclusions from a systematic review suggest effectiveness of guggul for hypercholesterolemia . Further research is warranted.\nIn vitro and in vivo  studies suggest that guggulsterone, a sterol from guggul, has anti-angiogenic  and anti-tumor properties, inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in a variety of tumor cells  including those resistant to chemotherapy ",

        "Weight loss"
      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "In vitro studies point to the effect of guggulsterone on the biosynthesis of cholesterol in the liver . Another study proposes that the cholesterol-lowering activity of guggulsterone in mice comes from its inhibition of FXR, a nuclear hormone receptor that is activated by bile acids. FXR mediates a negative feedback loop that decreases the rate of bile acid production by the liver. This loop is an important component in the regulation of cholesterol metabolism . Hypolipidemic outcomes may be better in individuals with a relatively higher capacity of metabolizing Z-guggulsterone with moderate carboxylesterase (CES1) induction Guggulsterone activates nuclear receptors such as estrogen receptor alpha, pregnane X receptor, and progesterone receptor and may induce CYP3A genes . In tumor cells, guggulsterone induces apoptosis by activating JNK  and repressing Akt signaling ",

However, many of the findings stem from laboratory and animal studies, in healthy volunteers, or in athletes. Although more studies in elderly and ill patients have recently been conducted, only a few were in cancer patients, and those results are mixed.",

      "Scientific Name": "Beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate",
      "Clinical Summary": "Beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB) is a metabolite of the amino acid leucine. It is often used as a body building supplement to help improve muscle strength by reducing protein breakdown. HMB is also added to some medical foods for patients with muscle wasting and cachexia.Small studies were initially conducted in active and younger men with mixed results on body composition and physical performance . A systematic review suggests that HMB may prevent exercise-related muscle damage in healthy trained and untrained individuals, as well as muscle loss during chronic disease However, research on HMB in clinical populations is limited. Studies in the eldery show that HMB benefits vascular endothelial function , reduces muscle breakdown , decreases abdominal fat mass , improves functional recovery after hip fracture , and reduces mortality . Other study results are mixed. HMB improved pulmonary function in COPD patients  and nitrogen balance in critically injured patients , but did not reduce co-morbidities in hemodialysis patients HMB is often used together with glutamine and arginine for muscle wasting and cachexia in patients with AIDS  and cancer . However, a large randomized trial in patients with cancer cachexia failed to demonstrate a significant effect . Additional research is needed . A small study showed that an HMB-containing supplement may help prevent radiation dermatitis in head and neck cancer patients ",

        "HIV- and AIDS-associated wasting",
        "Strength and stamina",
        "Weight gain"
      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "HMB is metabolized from the branched chain amino acid L-leucine endogenously through alpha-ketoisocaproic acid. Since only a small amount is converted from food sources, supplementation is used to increase intake. As a dietary supplement, HMB usually comes in calcium salt or free acid forms, the latter which is thought to have higher bioavailability . In muscle cells, HMB stimulates cell growth and survival through MAPK/ERK pathways . HMB restored balance between intracellular protein synthesis and breakdown by activating PI3K/Akt-dependent mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) . The stimulating effect of HMB on mTOR is eliminated with the introduction of rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor . However, it is unclear if HMB supplementation would also reduce the therapeutic effects of other mTOR inhibitors used in cancer treatment. HMB inhibits the ubiquitin-proteasome proteolytic pathway which governs the degradation of intracellular proteins  . In murine neuroblastoma cells, HMB exihibited neurotrophic effects In animal models, HMB reduced total subcutaneous fat content and LDL cholesterol , but did not affect circulating plasma levels of testosterone , cortisol, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), or insulin ",

      ],
      "Clinical Summary": "Homeopathy is a medical system developed 200 years ago by Dr. Samuel Hahnemann, a German physician. Promoted as a safer and more holistic approach to treating disease, it has remained especially popular in India and some European countries. Homeopathic remedies are highly diluted forms of botanical, animal, or mineral substances which when given in full strength to a healthy volunteer, cause the presenting symptoms of the patient. Many opponents argue that the benefits experienced by patients are merely placebo effects  although no larger than those observed in conventional medicine . Observational studies suggest that certain homeopathic products can provide long-term relief from symptoms such as headache and allergic rhinitis in adults, and atopic dermatitis and recurrent infections in children \nSome homeopathic ingredients in undiluted form demonstrated anticancer effects  in vitro. Clinical studies indicate that homeopathic medicine may be beneficial in treating dermatitis during radiotherapy  and for relief of post treatment pain in breast cancer patients . However, a homeopathic product was ineffective in controlling chemo-induced emesis . There are reports that complementing conventional treatment with homeopathy may improve fatigue and quality of life in cancer patients  and even as a treatment for advanced cancer , but these observations have not been evaluated in clinical trials.\nAllergic reactions and intoxications were reported following use of some homeopathic products \nCancer patients should be aware that homeopathy is not a substitute for mainstream care.",

However, it is not known if these products will have the same effects when diluted according to homeopathic principles.",

      "Clinical Summary": "Horse chestnut, a tree native to the Balkan Peninsula, has been used in traditional medicine for centuries. The seed extract is a popular dietary supplement used to support vascular functions. Horse chestnut should not be confused with sweet chestnut.\nEscin, also known as Aescin, a natural mixture of triterpenoid saponins isolated from the seed of the horse chestnut and the major active principle, was shown to have anti-inflammatory , neuroprotective , antitumor effects , and enhances the efficacy of gemcitabine . Data from clinical trials suggest efficacy of horse chestnut seed extract against chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) . Conclusions from systematic reviews and meta analysis state that horse chestnut extract is a safe and well tolerated treatment for CVI . Escin may also be effective in improving sperm quality in patients with varicocele-associated infertility \nPatients with compromised renal or hepatic function should not consume horse chestnut products.",

      "Mechanism of Action": "Escin, also known as Aescin, a natural mixture of triterpenoid saponins isolated from the seed of the horse chestnut has been identified as the active principle. The anti-inflammatory effects of escin involve significant downregulation of expression of certain inflammatory genes, and upregulation of expression of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), which also confers neuroprotection \nOne of the mechanisms by which escin reduces chronic venous insufficiency is thought to be via inhibition of elastase and hyaluronidase, both involved in enzymatic proteoglycan degradation, which constitutes part of the capillary endothelium and is also the main component of the extravascular matrix . The contraction of veins and arteries by horse chestnut is believed, partially, to be mediated through 5-HT(2A) receptors; horse chestnut also reduced platelet aggregation in vitro Beta-aescin and 5-fluorouracil were reported to inhibit human hepatocellular carcinoma SMMC-7721 cells, which may be due to the synergistic effects including cell-cycle arrest, induction of apoptosis, activation of caspases-3, 8 and 9, and down-regulation of Bcl-2 expression .

      "How It Works": "Hoxsey Herbal Therapy is not a cancer cure and some of its components may be dangerous.\nHoxsey herbal tonic was developed by Harry Hoxsey’s great grandfather after his horse was cured of a leg tumor by eating wild herbs. Hoxsey combined these herbs with home cancer remedies popular at the time to create a tonic to be taken by mouth, as well as a preparation for topical application. Hoxsey’s remedies were promoted in newspapers and through his clinic through the first half of the 20th century, but eventually the U.S. government forced him to stop selling medicines without a medical license.\nAccording to Hoxsey, the tonic stimulates detoxification of the body while normalizing cell metabolism. However there is no proof for this. His tonic has never been tested in the laboratory, in animals, or in humans, and there is no scientific evidence to support the claim that it has anticancer effects in the human body. Hoxsey also claimed that his topical medicine would selectively kill cancer cells, however the caustic ingredients contained in the ointment are known to burn healthy tissue as well.The American Cancer Society strongly urges cancer patients not to use the Hoxsey treatment.",
      "Purported Uses": [
        [
          "To treat cancer",
          "No scientific evidence supports this use. Although some researchers have attempted to follow patients who used Hoxsey herbal therapy at clinics in Mexico, studies could not be conducted as the record keeping was poor."
        ]
      ],
      "Side Effects": [
        "The topical paste and powder have caused severe burns, scars, and disfigurement.",
        "High levels of iodine from the potassium iodide can cause pimples, excessive secretion of the eyes or nose, impotence, and inflammation of salivary glands.",
        "Buckthorn, one of the ingredients in the herbal tonic, is a violent laxative, and can cause abdominal pain, dehydration, anxiety, decreased respirations, diarrhea, nausea, trembling, and vomiting.",
        [
          "Cascara,",
          "one of the ingredients in the herbal tonic, is a laxative and can cause abdominal pain, cramping, diarrhea, discoloration of urine, fluid and electrolyte imbalance, osteomalacia (softening of the bones), steatorrhea (fat in the feces), vitamin and mineral deficiencies, and vomiting."
        ],
        [
          "Licorice,",
          "one of the ingredients in the herbal tonic, can cause interact with the body’s hormones and lead to imbalances in water, sodium, and potassium retention. High blood pressure, fatigue, muscle pain, cardiac arrhythmias, hypokalemia (low levels of potassium in the blood), and decreased libido can result."

        [
          "Pokeweed,",
          "one of the ingredients in the herbal tonic, causes nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal cramps. Ingestion has been associated with illnesses requiring hospitalization, and has caused deaths in children."
        ]
      ],
      "Clinical Summary": "An alternative therapy consisting of herbal tonics and restrictive diets, the Hoxsey treatment is promoted as a cancer cure. It is illegal in the United States, but is available at the Bio-Medical Center and other clinics in Tijuana, Mexico. According to the inventor Harry Hoxsey, the principal “brown” tonic contains potassium iodide, licorice,red cloverburdock rootstillingia root, barberry, cascara, pokeweed, prickly ash bark, and buckthorn bark. The diet involves eliminating pork, vinegar, tomatoes, pickles, carbonated drinks, alcohol, bleached flour, sugar and salt, and emphasizes iron, calcium, vitamin C, yeast supplements and grape juice. Hoxsey claims the treatment detoxifies the body, strengthens the immune system, balances body chemistry, and allows the body to digest and excrete tumors. Superoxide dismutase (SOD), vitamin B12, Gerovital (a mixture of procaine hydrochloride and vitamins), “Prolobin liver,” TST-100, rosette cactus, Koch Antitoxins, BCG vaccine, and Shulte’s medications sometimes are included in the regimen.\nHoxsey was convicted many times for practicing medicine without a license. The U.S. government reported that the 400 patients Hoxsey claimed to have cured never had cancer, were cured before receiving his treatment, still had cancer, or had died from the disease . The National Cancer Institute evaluated 77 case reports submitted by Hoxsey and concluded that none showed efficacy . No clinical data support the value of this therapy.The American Cancer Society strongly urges cancer patients not to use the Hoxsey treatment, as no objective evidence exists to support its efficacy ",
      "Purported Uses2": [
        "Cancer treatment"
      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "Hoxsey claims that the internal formulation “stimulates the elimination of toxins that poison the system, thereby correcting the abnormal blood chemistry and normalizing cell metabolism.” His head nurse added that it restores acid/base balance, normal metabolism, and immune function, and “deals with the DNA.” None of these claims is substantiated by scientific data. The herbal tonic was developed by Hoxsey’s great grandfather, whose horse was reportedly cured of a leg tumor after eating wild herbs. Hoxsey combined these herbs with home remedies to create the “brown” tonic. In vitro and animal studies conducted with individual components (e.g., licorice, red clover, burdock, pokeroot, stillingia, barberry - see individual monographs) indicate possible anti-tumor and immunostimulant properties, but their concentrations and activity in the tonic have not been determined ",
      "Adverse Reactions": "External paste and powder: Severe burns, scars, and disfigurement can occur with use of the external treatments.Iodine toxicity: “Iodisms” can result from intake as low as 60 mg/day or long-term use, causing pimples, excessive secretion of the eyes or nose, impotence, and inflammation of salivary glands.Buckthorn: A violent laxative, causing abdominal pain, dehydration, anxiety, decreased respirations, diarrhea, nausea, trembling, vomiting.Cascara: Only approved for short-term use. Laxative effects can cause abdominal pain, cramping, diarrhea, discoloration of urine, fluid and electrolyte imbalance, osteomalacia, steatorrhea, vitamin and mineral deficiencies, vomiting.Licorice: Hypertension, lethargy, muscle pain, cardiac arrhythmias, sodium retention, hypokalemia, hyper-mineralcorticoidism, pseudo-hyperaldosteronism, decreased libido in men, and suppression of scalp sebum secretionPokeweed: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps. Ingestion has been associated with illnesses requiring hospitalization, and has caused deaths in children and heart block.",

      "How It Works": "There are not enough data which show that huanglian can treat cancer, high blood pressure, infections, or any other medical condition.\nHuanglian is a root extract that is used in traditional Chinese medicine. Laboratory experiments have been performed with huanglian to study its possible anticancer activity. A substance called berberine in huanglian has been found to slow the replication of liver cancer cells in the laboratory by interfering with the mechanisms of cell division. Berberine also halts the growth of bacteria by interfering with their metabolism. Scientists think that berberine may have antidiarrheal activity due to its ability to slow down intestinal peristalsis (motion), but they are unsure exactly how this effect happens. The ability of berberine to lower blood pressure is attributed to its effects in the body that resemble parasympathetic nervous system stimulation (e.g., impulses to “rest and digest” rather than “fight or flight”). Human studies are needed.",

      "Scientific Name": "Coptis chinensis",
      "Clinical Summary": "Derived from the root of the plant, huanglian is used in traditional Chinese medicine for gastrointestinal complaints, diarrhea, hypertension, bacterial and viral infections. Berberine and berberine-like alkaloids are thought responsible for its activity . Studies show that berberine has hepatoprotective , anti-inflammatory  effects, and improves glucose metabolism in diabetic rats . Jatrorrhizine, a protoberberine, was shown to offset postoperative ileus-induced delayed gastric emptying, and intestinal transit in rats \nBerberine also inhibits the growth of hepatoma cancer cells ; an aqueous extract of huanglian demonstrated potent antiangiogenesis activity in vitro .

      "Mechanism of Action": "Berberine and berberine-like compounds in huanglian are thought responsible for its activity. Berberine inhibits human hep-62 hepatoma cell growth due to morphological changes and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation . It was shown to modulate gastric peristalsis resulting in antidiarrheal activity; modulate bacterial metabolism of carbohydrates, protein synthesis, and complex with nucleic acids resulting in growth inhibition. The herb’s hypotensive effects are thought to be mediated by muscarinic stimulation and inhibition of cholinesterase. In studies conducted on dogs, berberine showed positive inotropic effects and lowered peripheral vascular resistance.Berberine also inhibits platelet aggregation and can antagonize thromboxane B2. It can cause potassium channel blockade resulting in prolongation of the action potential in cat ventricular monocytes Huanglian inhibits topoisomerase I and is thought to suppress cyclin B1 protein, and cause cancer cell arrest at G2 phase . It also has potent antiangiogenic activity , induces apoptosis and arrests cell growth by upregulating Interferon beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha genes in breast cancer cells ",

Animal studies show it has antiapoptotic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidative properties which contribute to its protective effects in nerve agent poisoning , myasthenia gravis , hepatic reperfusion injury , and diabetes-associated cognitive decline . Clinical studies on Huperzine A as a treatment for Alzheimer’s disease have yielded mixed results . One study found it to improve cognitive function in vascular dementia patients Although a US patent has been filed claiming its use for cancer pain and neuropathy  , no clinical trials for these indications have been conducted.Mild adverse effects from Huperzine A have been reported . Because it acts as an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, it can potentially interact with many drugs including other anticholinergic drugs, dopamine D2 receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers, and beta adrenergic receptor antagonists ",
      "Purported Uses2": [
        "Alzheimer’s disease",
        "Dementia, cognitive decline",
        "Nerve agent poisoning",
        "Myasthenia gravis",
        "Neuropathy"
      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "Huperzine A is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, raising the levels of acetylcholine in the basal ganglia . Higher levels of acetylcholine in the central nervous system are believed to be responsible for less severe cognitive impairment in Alzheimer’s disease . Additionally, Huperzine A can interfere with the pathway of beta-amyloid deposition by regulating precursor protein metabolism and impeding associated neurotoxicity . Huperzine A also inhibits the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in the cerebral cortex Huperzine A diminished diabetes-associated cognitive decline in rats by enhancing glycemic control, suppressing inflammation, augmenting brain-derived neurotrophic factor expression, and limiting oxidative stress . In a mouse model of hepatic ischemia reperfusion injury, the antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic properties of Huperzine A contributed to hepatoprotective effects ",
      "Adverse Reactions": "Nausea, anorexia, dizziness, vomiting, constipation, insomnia, excitability, thirst, sweating, bradycardia, abdominal pain, somnolence, hyperactivity, nasal obstruction, diarrhea, and edema . Some of these reactions could stem from the anticholinesterase activity of Huperzine A.",
      "Herb-Drug Interactions": "Cytochrome P450 substrates: Huperzine A induces CYP3A4 by activating pregnane X receptor . This may reduce the effectiveness of drugs metabolized by this enzyme.Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (Donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine): Huperzine A may increase the risk of adverse events for other drugs that have acetylcholinesterase inhibition effects.Dopamine D2 receptor blockers: Taken in conjunction with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors can produce a dopamine/acetylcholine imbalance in the striatum, leading to parkinsonian symptoms Calcium channel blockers: Because acetylcholinesterase inhibitors can produce bradycardia on their own, Huperzine A and a calcium channel blocker may produce a more severe bradycardia Beta adrenergic receptor antagonists: Because acetylcholinesterase inhibitors can produce bradycardia on their own, Huperzine A and a calcium channel blocker may produce a more severe bradycardia ",

      "How It Works": "Hydrazine sulfate is not an approved cancer treatment. It has been shown to increase the incidence of some cancers.\nHydrazine sulfate is a chemical used in industrial manufacturing of agricultural chemicals and rocket fuel. Supporters of this therapy make the false claim that hydrazine sulfate limits the ability of tumor cells to make glucose, an important source of their energy, from body stores. In theory, this would also prevent the accelerated breakdown of protein in the body that causes cachexia (wasting) in patients with advanced cancer. However, this effect has never been shown in humans. Hydrazine sulfate was able to inhibit the growth of some tumors in laboratory animals when used alone or with chemotherapy drugs, but this effect has also not been shown in humans. Furthermore, hydrazine sulfate has been shown to increase the incidence of breast, lung, and liver cancers and basal cell carcinoma.Hydrazine sulfate is commercially available in the United States, but it is illegal to use it as a cancer therapy. It is classified as a potential carcinogen by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.",

        "Multiple basal cell carcinomas were reported in a 68-year-old man following extensive exposure to hydrazine sulfate."
      ],
      "Clinical Summary": "A synthetic chemical (HN-HSO) primarily used in industrial manufacturing (e.g. agricultural chemicals, rocket fuel, etc), hydrazine sulfate is used to treat cancer, maintain or gain weight, and ameliorate cancer-related cachexia. It is thought to interfere with gluconeogenesis via the inhibition of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase . It has moderate monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAO-I) activity \nAnimal studies suggest that hydrazine is carcinogenic, although it is not established in humans. Several large randomized clinical trials failed to show significant benefit from hydrazine supplementation  to alleviate cancer-related cachexia  or to improve cancer survival.\nPotential adverse effects include nausea, pruritus, dizziness, peripheral neuropathies, hypoglycemia and insomnia . Case reports detailing fatal hepatorenal failure  and encephalopathy  exist in the literature. Potential drug interactions include increased hydrazine toxicity when combined with benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and alcohol . Theoretically, foods high in tyramine content, meperidine, sympathomimetics, and dextromethorphan should be avoided due to MAO-I activity Hydrazine sulfate is classified as a potential carcinogen by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.",

        "Cancer-related cachexia",
        "Weight gain",

      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "Hydrazine sulfate is thought to inhibit phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, an enzyme involved with the Cori cycle for gluconeogenesis from anaerobically metabolized lactic acid. Hydrazine therapy is used to antagonize the inappropriate activation of gluconeogenesis pathways, reduce excessive gluconeogenesis, and improve glucose tolerance particularly in patients with cancer and cancer-related cachexia . Hydrazine also has been shown to be a weak monoamine oxidase inhibitor . Inhibition and stabilization of glioblastoma cell growth was seen in vitro and in animal models , but significance in humans is unknown. Hydrazine sulfate appears to have no effect on prostate cancer cell lines in vitro ",

      "Mechanism of Action": "Indirubin inhibits DNA synthesis in rats and cell proliferation in the late-G1 and G2/M phases by selectively inhibiting cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK)  by interacting with the kinase’s ATP-binding site . Indirubin-3-oxime inhibits the growth of human laryngeal cancer cells via induction of CDK inhibitor p21, cyclin D1 inhibition, and caspase-3 activation . Indirubin may also play a role in inhibiting microtubule assembly, further reducing the rate of cell reproduction . Its anti-inflammatory effects may be due to interferon-gamma inhibition Indirubin is a minor constituent of Indigofera tinctoria; a synthetic form of the substance was shown to have similar effectiveness against CML . One study investigated the inhibitory effect of six indirubin derivatives against HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells . One of these derivatives strongly inhibited the growth of HL-60 cancer cells, whereas the others showed only weak cytotoxic activity. An additional study found that four indirubin derivatives exhibited antiproliferative activity against human HT-29 colorectal cancer cells in a solid tumor model . IDR-E804, another indirubin derivative, was shown to inhibit angiogenesis by decreasing proliferation, migration and tube formation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-treated human umbilical vein endothelial cells. These effects were accompanied by decreased phosphorylation of VEGF receptor-2, AKT, and extracellular signal regulated kinases . Another study reported that mitochondrial dysfunction may be an important mechanism via which indirubin-3’-oxime induces cell-cycle arrest in human neuroblastoma cells Indirubin modulates proliferation and differentiation of keratinocytes derived from patients with psoriasis  ",

It is known to stimulate detoxifying enzymes in the gut and liver. Because diets high in these vegetables slow cancer growth in animals, I3C is thought to be a good candidate for cancer prevention. Laboratory studies show that I3C may have anticancer activities across a variety of tumor types, and may have added benefit with some chemotherapy drugs. However, other animal studies suggest that I3C might also promote tumor growth. Additional studies and human clinical trials are needed to determine the circumstances under which I3C might be suitable for cancer prevention.",

      "Clinical Summary": "Indole-3-Carbinol (I3C) is a phytochemical derived from the breakdown of glucosinolates found in cruciferous vegetables including Brussels sprouts, kale, broccoli, cabbage, and cauliflower . Epidemiologic studies suggest that a diet high in cruciferous vegetables is associated with a lower risk of cancer and that I3C has anticarcinogenic properties across a wide range of cancers Various in vitro and in vivo studies suggest antimicrobial , anti-inflammatory , anti-estrogenic  , and antiangiogenic  effects. Antiproliferative and anticancer effects have been demonstrated in human breast , prostate , melanoma , endometrial  , liver , and pancreatic cancer cells , as well as animal models of lung , laryngeal , and nasopharyngeal carcinoma . In addition, preliminary experiments suggest I3C may potentiate or have sensitizing effects in combination with bortezomib , tamoxifen , doxorubicin , vemurafenib , fludarabine , gemcitabine , or acetylsalicylic acid , and may reverse cytotoxicity with dexamethasone  or cardiotoxicity with doxorubicin  . However, these effects have not been confirmed in humans. Studies in animal carcinogenesis models suggest that I3C may also promote tumor growth . Additional studies are needed to determine under what conditions I3C could be a suitable chemopreventive agent in humans.Data from early phase clinical trials suggested that I3C is effective against precancerous cervical dysplasia  and vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia . In premenopausal women, a supplement containing I3C and 7-hydroxymatairesinol, a dietary ingredient, increased the urinary 2:16-hydroxyestrone ratio, a known biomarker for the reduction of breast cancer risk . More recently, an RCT of a diindolylmethane formulation (DIM, an active I3C metabolite) in breast cancer patients on tamoxifen suggest it encourages beneficial changes in estrogen metabolism and circulating sex hormone-binding globulin levels I3C is generally well tolerated when taken orally, but it is unclear if I3C supplementation can benefit humans due to its mixed effects in preliminary studies and its ability to induce cytochrome P450 enzymes , which may cause interactions with several medications. In addition, a recent study to measure Brassica consumption in humans suggests that the chemopreventive effects derived from cruciferous vegetable consumption may plateau and not require eating large quantities or taking high-dose supplements ",

      "Mechanism of Action": "Indole-3-carbinol (I3C) is a natural indolecarbinol compound derived from the breakdown of glucobrassicin produced in cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli and Brussels sprouts . Some of the health-protective effects of I3C are attributed to epigenetic mechanisms such as the regulation of HDAC and HAT activities and acetylation of histones and non-histone chromatin proteins Preliminary studies suggest several benefits to immune function. I3C counteracted immune evasion mechanisms of HPV16 by antagonizing E6 repression of E-cadherin . It decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine production and T cell activation by acting as histone deacetylase class I (HDAC-I) inhibitors . Other anti-inflammatory mechanisms include regulation of TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β (TRIF)-dependent signaling pathways In cancer cells, I3C at higher doses (400 μM) induced apoptosis, while lower doses (200 μM) inihbited cell growth as well as cyclin E and CDK2 expression . It is among compounds that exert antiproliferative and/or proapoptotic effects through regulation of one or more microRNAs (miRNAs), short noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression by messenger RNA (mRNA) degradation or translation repression I3C may act as a chemopreventive agent for breast cancer through its estrogen receptor (ER) modulating effect  or upregulation of apoptotic enzyme activities . It disrupted ER alpha-mediated transcription within IGF1 cascade cell signaling components , downregulated expression of estrogen-responsive genes pS2 and cathepsin-D, and upregulated BRAC1 . Other inhibitory mechanisms include suppressing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), blocking extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/Sp1-mediated gene transcription, reducing matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 activities, and decreasing aromatase expression . One randomized clinical trial suggests that the decreased risk of ER-sensitive breast and cervical cancers with I3C may be due to an increase in the 2-OH-estrone:estriol metabolite ratio In HepG2 cells, I3C induced phase II and antioxidant enzymes . Other hepatoprotective mechanisms include immunomodulation and inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines . Acute hepatic inflammation was suppressed via decreased miR-31 expression and subsequent caspase-2-dependent apoptosis in T cells . In human lung carcinoma A549 cells, I3C significantly reduced cell proliferation and induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase . In murine models, chemopreventive effects against lung tumors occurred via reductions in levels of proinflammatory and procarcinogenic proteins . In melanoma cells, I3C induced G1-phase cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis by stabilization of PTEN that express wild-type PTEN . In prostate cancer cells, I3C inhibits androgen-dependent pathways and appeared to block the inflammatory microenvironment , and caused apoptosis by inhibiting Akt activation I3C coadministration with doxorubicin potentiated cytotoxic effects compared with either agent alone in pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells . Chemosensitive effects were produced in gemcitabine-resistant pancreatic cancer cells via microRNA-21 downregulation . I3C also lowered the LD50 of gemcitabine and decreased growth of pancreatic cancer cells, possibly through reactivation of the tumor suppressor gene p16. I3C with genistein produced synergy of apotosis and tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) in endometrial cancer cells . It reversed dexamethasone cytotoxicity via ROS inhibition and enhanced nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2 (Nrf2) expression Some animal studies suggest that I3C is both an inhibitor and promoter of carcinogenesis with strong induction of placental glutathione S-transferase foci in the liver , and modulatory activity that included apoptotic inhibition in colon tumors . In addition, I3C may promote endometrial adenocarcinoma through hepatic CYP1 induction and estrogen metabolism modulation ",

In laboratory experiments, it inhibited events involved in blood clotting. When various types of cancer cells were incubated with IP6 in a Petri dish, it slowed their replication. IP6 may also turn cancer cells into more “normal” cells. However, it is unknown whether these effects can take place in the human body.A small study of breast cancer patients showed that IP6 in combination with inositol may reduce chemotherapy side effects.

      "Clinical Summary": "A ubiquitous intracellular molecule present in mammalian cells and obtained from various dietary sources such as grains and legumes, inositol hexaphosphate (IP6) is used to prevent and treat cancer and heart disease. Metabolites of IP6 enter the inositol phosphates pool and perform secondary messenger roles, extracellular signaling, and additional cellular signalling transduction IP6 was shown to be useful against sickle cell disease in vitro  and in mice . Several in vitro and animal studies also suggest anticancer  and antiangiogenic  effects.Preliminary studies in humans indicate that a combination of IP6 and inositol may alleviate chemotherapy side effects and improve quality of life in breast cancer patients , and that myo-inositol may have chemopreventive potential in patients with bronchial dysplasia . Large-scale studies are warranted to determine safety and efficacy ",

      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "IP6 can be synthesized from inositol or obtained from the diet. Metabolites and derivatives of IP6 perform secondary messenger roles, including mobilization of intracellular calcium for mitosis. Extracellular signaling also has been demonstrated. IP6 interacts with both tyrosine kinase and PLC-coupled growth factor receptors. IP6 also enters the inositol phosphates pool, is subsequently dephosphorylated, and contributes to additional cellular signal transduction and intracellular functions . In vitro and animal studies suggest that IP6 reduces initiation and/or promotion, inhibits proliferation by chelation of metalloproteins, causes G0/G1 arrest, and induces differentiation of various cancer cell lines . IP6 also may inhibit in vitro platelet activation with ADP, collagen, and thrombin by interacting with platelet cytoskeletal reorganization, P13-K activity, or agonist-induced platelet aggregation ",
      "Herb-Drug Interactions": "Mineral supplements: Phytic acid can bind with calcium, iron, magnesium, and zinc in the stomach and reduce their bioavailability Anticoagulants/antiplatelet agents: IP6 has antiplatelet activity. It may increase the risk of bleeding when used with other anticoagulants or antiplatelet drugs ",

      "How It Works": "Insulin Potentiation Therapy is not effective in treating cancer.\nInsulin potentiation therapy involves administering insulin at the same time as chemotherapy drugs, with the idea that lower chemotherapy doses are then needed because insulin lets more of the drug enter cells. However, this has never been proven experimentally.In general, insulin should not been taken by nondiabetics because it can decrease blood sugar to dangerously low levels, causing symptoms such as headache and delirium.",

      "Side Effects": [
        "Low blood sugar"
      ],
      "Clinical Summary": "Insulin Potentiation Therapy (IPT) is an alternative cancer therapy that uses insulin to potentiate the effect of chemotherapy and other medications. This therapy was developed in Mexico by Dr. Donato Perez Garcia in the 1930s and has been used together with other unconventional therapies for many years . Advocates of IPT believe that cancer cells consume more sugar than healthy cells and are therefore more sensitive to insulin and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) . Insulin is also believed to increase the permeability of cell membranes, increasing the intracellular concentration and cytotoxic effect of anticancer drugs . According to the theory underlying this therapy, if cancer cells can be activated by exogenous insulin, a reduced dose (up to one-tenth the normal dose) of a chemotherapy drug can provide the same cytotoxic effects with less severe adverse reactions. No clinical trials have been performed to validate these claims. In addition, the pharmacokinetic profiles on concurrent use of insulin and chemotherapy drugs are lacking and it is unclear whether insulin also potentiates toxic effects of chemotherapy on healthy cells.Although proponents cite anecdotal case reports suggesting that IPT may be effective, there are no data comparing the efficacy of IPT to conventional chemotherapy. Most of the medications used in this therapy, such as insulin and other chemotherapy drugs, are FDA-approved but IPT clinics administer them “off-label.” Further, some clinics that administer IPT are not operated or staffed by oncologists.Side effects of IPT include hypoglycemic reaction. A systematic review of 21 studies showed a correlation between circulating levels of IGF-I, IGFBP3 (IGF-binding protein) and an increased risk of common cancers ",
      "Purported Uses2": [
        "Cancer treatment"
      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "IPT is a treatment strategy that utilizes the physiological activities of insulin. It is based on the theory that insulin and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) play an important role in the cell cycle. IGF has been shown to affect proliferation, adhesion, and migration of normal as well as cancerous cells  and certain IGF receptors are found to be overexpressed in many forms of cancer. Therefore, cancer cells may be selectively more sensitive than normal cells to IGF IGF receptors can be activated by exogenous insulin. Insulin is also believed to increase the permeability of cell membranes, leading to the increased intracellular concentrations and cytotoxic effects of anticancer drugs.Proponents argue that insulin synergistically enhances the efficacy of anticancer drugs so that a reduced dose can be used with similar cytotoxic effects . However, the role of IGF receptors in cancer treatment appears to be more complex. At least one study has demonstrated that IGF receptor inhibition can also increase the effects of anticancer drugs ",

      "Clinical Summary": "Isatis leaf is derived from the isatis plant and is a source of indigo dye. In both traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and Ayurveda, it is used in combination with isatis root and other herbs to treat the common cold, sore throat, mumps, respiratory ailments, other febrile diseases, hepatitis, and malignant tumors . The pulverized form, known as Qing Dai, has been used to treat ulcerative colitis , and topically to treat oral sores and sore throat. Isatis leaf is one of the ingredients used in PC-SPES, an herbal formula used to treat prostate cancer. It is also used in Danggui Longhui Wan, a formula used to treat chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML) in China In vitro and in vivo studies indicate that isatis has antimicrobial, antiendotoxic , antiviral , immunostimulatory , anti-inflammatory , and chemotherapeutic  properties. In several instances, the pharmacologic effects of isatis leaves were found to be greater than that of the roots . A small preliminary study in healthy volunteers has also indicated anti-inflammatory  properties with topical isatis leaf.Isatis root has both overlapping and different properties from isatis leaf.",

The alkaloid tryptanthrin has been identified as the inhibitor of COX-2  and 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) . Indirubin, another active component, inhibits cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and prevents proliferation by arresting cells in the G2/M phase . Other alkaloids isolated from isatis can inhibit leukocyte function and attenuate the production of mediators related to inflammatory responses . A compound isolated from isatisine A showed moderate anti-HIV-1 activity . One laboratory study found better virucidal activity for leaf than root extracts when tested for swine pseudorabies virus Animal models suggest that isatis leaf can reduce allergic airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness by inhibiting production of Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-5, and RANTES . Another model suggests that when used as postexposure prophylaxis, isatis leaf can attenuate lung tissue damage and reduce lung virus titers In vitro and animal studies demonstrated the induction of hepatocellular cancer cell death by isatis through a distinguished caspase-independent apoptotic pathway ",

      "How It Works": "Isatis root has not been extensively studied in clinical trials, so it is not known if it works in humans.Isatis root extract is derived from the same plant from which indigo dye is made. It has been used in combination with other botanicals in traditional Chinese medicine and Ayurveda for thousands of years.In animal tests, it reduced inflammation, fever, and pain perception. Isatis also stimulated immune cells in tissues that destroy foreign particles as they pass in the bloodstream. Laboratory studies suggest that indirubin, an active compound in isatis, stops cell duplication and therefore may be useful in cancer treatment. Other lab experiments show that isatis extract can kill certain viruses and counteract some symptoms and tissue damage from bacterial infections, but it remains uncertain whether these same effects occur in the human body.A small study indicates that an isatis root extract solution may be helpful in reducing radiation-induced mucositis in head and neck cancer patients.Isatis leaf has both similar and different properties from isatis root.",
      "Purported Uses": [
        [
          "To treat bronchitis and relieve chest congestion",
          "Laboratory research suggests that isatis root has anti-inflammatory and immune-stimulating activity, but there is no proof from clinical trials that it can relieve bronchitis and chest congestion."

          "Lab studies show that an active compound in isatis stops cell duplication, but there is no evidence from clinical trials that it can prevent or treat cancer. In China, isatis is used in combination with other botanicals to treat chronic myelogenous leukemia."
        ],
        [
          "To reduce severity of radiation-induced mucositis",
          "A small study in head and neck cancer patients suggested that a specific isatis root extract solution could reduce severity of mucositis, anorexia, and difficulty swallowing in treated patients compared with a control group."

        ]
      ],
      "Patient Warnings": [
        "Some compounds in isatis root could have activity against SARS, but these are only lab experiments. These compounds would need to be further developed and tested because many compounds in isatis root have been found to occur at low levels. Relying solely on herbal supplements to prevent or treat SARS may induce a false sense of security from this deadly disease. Patients with suspected SARS should limit interactions outside the home. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends proper hygiene such as frequent hand washing and wearing a surgical mask to help prevent the spread of SARS."
      ],
      "Side Effects": "Oral: None reported.Eyedrops:  Feeling a foreign substance or irritation in the eyes (one report each). Symptoms resolved after the patients closed their eyes and rested for 3 minutes.",
      "Brand Name": "Ban Lan Gen Chong Ji",
      "Scientific Name": "Radix isatidis baphicacanthi, Isatis tinctoria, Isatis indigotica",
      "Clinical Summary": "Isatis root is derived from the isatis plant and is a source of indigo dye. In both traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and Ayurveda, it is used in combination with isatis leaf and other herbs to treat the common cold, sore throat, mumps, respiratory ailments, other febrile diseases, hepatitis, and malignant tumors . One such formula, Danggui Longhui Wan, is used in China to treat chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML) . Isatis root has also been promoted to ward off severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).In vitro assays have identified specific compounds in isatis root with potential anti-SARS  and anti-influenza activity , as well as cytotoxic activity against human liver cancer and leukemia cell lines . Several in vitro and animal studies also demonstrate antimicrobial , antiviral , anti-endotoxic , immunostimulatory , chemotherapeutic , and radioprotective effects . Animal models indicate anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, and antinociceptive effects In one clinical trial, isatis root eyedrops were an effective treatment for bacterial conjunctivitis . A small randomized study demonstrated the utility of an isatis root extract solution for significantly reducing severity of radiation mucositis, anorexia, and swallowing difficulty in head and neck cancer patients  Isatis leaf has both overlapping and different properties from isatis root.",

        "Infections",
        "Radiation-induced mucositis",
        "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)"
      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "Isatis root exerts immunostimulatory effects by enhancing reticuloendothelial system function . Sinigrin and indigo have been identified as the compounds responsible for potential SARS inhibition . Clemastanin B, a major lignan compound in isatis, targets viral endocytosis, uncoating, and nuclear export of viral ribonucleoproteins . A crude extract of isatis root prevented influenza virus attachment to cells and therefore viral replication, but was inactive against respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus and enterovirus . Another component of isatis root demonstrates dose-dependent anti-endotoxic effects on lipopolysaccharide-induced expression of membrane-organizing extension spike protein, a main endotoxin receptor . Alkaloids isolated from isatis can inhibit leukocyte function and reduce inflammatory response . One animal study found that indigo root extract reduced tissue injury, enhanced hematopoietic system recovery, modulated serum inflammatory cytokines, and improved severe enteropathy in whole body irradiated mice An in vitro study also found that an ethanol extract of isatis root had a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect against human leukemia HL-60 cells . Indirubin, an active component of isatis, inhibits cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and prevents proliferation by arresting cells in the G2/M phase ",
      "Warnings": "Although some compounds have been identified as exhibiting potential for SARS inhibition, they would need to be developed and tested for efficacy. Many compounds in isatis root occur at low levels . In addition, as SARS is a deadly disease, reliance on herbal supplements as prevention or treatment may induce a false sense of security. Patients with suspected SARS should limit interactions outside the home. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends proper hygiene such as frequent hand washing and wearing a surgical mask to help prevent the spread of SARS ",
      "Adverse Reactions": "Oral: None reported.Eyedrops: One report each of feeling a foreign substance and another of irritating pain in the eyes. Symptoms resolved after the patients closed their eyes and rested for 3 minutes ",

      "Brand Name": "Juice Plus+®",
      "Clinical Summary": "Juice Plus (JP) is a formulation derived from a variety of fruits and vegetables and contains additional vitamins. It is marketed to complement daily diet based on the notion that people do not consume enough fruits and vegetables. Studies on bioavailability suggest that consumption of JP can increase serum levels of alpha-carotene, vitamin C, and folate  but studies with other markers, such as lutein and alpha-tocopherol yielded mixed results. JP was comparable to standard vitamin C and E supplements  but it remains unclear if this product is nutritionally superior to fresh produce. JP was shown to decrease plasma homocysteine levels, a risk factor for cardiovascular disease , but the results were not reproducible . Studies on cardiovascular effects, such as changes in blood pressure and cholesterol levels are inconclusive . JP consumption is thought to reduce oxidative stress and DNA damage , and has been associated with a reduction in the symptoms of common cold \nGastrointestinal distress  and hive-like rash  have been associated with intake of JP in clinical trials.While there is ongoing research using JP in cancer patients, it has not been proven to prevent or treat cancers. Due to its antioxidant effects, JP may interfere with the actions of some chemotherapy drugs. Cancer patients should discuss the use of supplements with their physicians. JP is not a substitute for fresh fruits and vegetables.",
      "Purported Uses2": [
        "Cancer prevention",
        "Cardiovascular disease",
        "Weight loss"
      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "JP is thought to have antioxidant and immunomodulating properties. It reduces some biomarkers of oxidative stress but not others . Inflammatory cytokine TNF alpha production increased up to 8 weeks following consumption of JP but decreased thereafter. It had no effect on other markers including IL-4, IL-6, superoxide dismutase or glutathione . JP decreased levels of plasma homocysteine, a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases , but failed to show similar effects in another study . Intake of phytochemical antioxidants may have protective effect on endothelial function by preserving the bioactivity of nitric oxide . JP’s effects on regulating blood pressure are mixed. Consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables can lower cholesterol levels due to their high fiber content, whereas JP extract did not appreciably alter cholesterol levels ",
      "Adverse Reactions": "Gastrointestinal distress  and hive-like rash  were reported in clinical studies.Case ReportHepatotoxicity linked to JP use:  A 51-year-old woman with endometrial cancer experienced elevated liver function tests and interference with allopathic therapies. The patient discontinued using the product and liver function tests normalized over 4 weeks ",
      "Herb-Drug Interactions": "Chemotherapy drugs: Theoretically, antioxidants can decrease the efficacy of certain chemotherapy drugs that rely on the generation of free radicals for their cytotoxic effects.

      "Scientific Name": "Piper methysticum",
      "Clinical Summary": "Derived from the rhizome of the plant, kava is from the Pacific Rim and Hawaiian Islands. It is used as a social beverage in those areas and to relieve anxiety, stress, and insomnia. Kavalactones in kava are thought to be the active constituent that produces skeletal muscle relaxation, non-narcotic anesthesia, and local anesthetic effects.An Internet-based study showed that kava is not superior to placebo in reducing anxiety , and a randomized clinical trial reported similar findings . However, data from several studies support the use of kava for relieving anxiety . It has also been suggested as an alternative to benzodiazepines, which are used to treat anxiety. A systematic review showed that kava does not have negative effects on cognition  Although available data suggest kava’s benefits for anxiety, the Canadian, French, and British governments withdrew kava and kava-containing products due to concerns of hepatotoxicity The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has advised consumers about the potential risks of liver injury associated with kava consumption. However, following a World Health Organization (WHO) recommendation to study aqueous extracts of kava, initial research results support the benefits of kava . Case analyses of 14 patients with hepatic injury resulting from kava use revealed low-quality products, overdose, prolonged use and co-medication as causative factors . Additional studies are needed to confirm these findings.\nKava consumption has been associated with low cancer incidence , but one of its constituents was shown to stimulate growth of melanoma cells ",

        "Insomnia",
        "Restlessness",
        "Stress"
      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "Kavapyrones are centrally-acting skeletal muscle relaxants, anticonvulsants, and peripherally-acting local anesthetics. There are conflicting data on the effects of kavapyrones on CNS levels of dopamine and serotonin . Possible hepatotoxicity mechanisms are thought to be cytochrome P450 inhibition, reduction in liver glutathione content, or inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) activity In vitro and in vivo studies suggest that kavapyrone- and pipermethystine-containing extracts induce mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and apoptosis of Hep2G cells Kava enhances acetaminophen-induced cytotoxicity by increasing glutathione (GSH) depletion, resulting in oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, ultimately resulting in cell death ",
      "Warnings": [
        "Kava may cause hepatotoxicity, and elevated gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) levels were detected in regular kava drinkers",
        "The British, French, and Swiss governments have requested that kava be removed from the market",
        "The Canadian government has warned consumers not to use kava-containing products",
        "Discontinue kava use before surgery as it may interact with anesthetics. Kava may also impair ability to drive or operate heavy machinery"

        ],
        "Overdose of kava resulted in altered mental status and ataxia"
      ],
      "Herb-Drug Interactions": "Benzodiazepines: Kava may enhance sedation when administered concurrently. Kava indirectly increases the affinity of GABA receptor binding sites in vitro Barbiturates: Theoretically, kava may have an additive effect on sedation and muscle-relaxant activity; however, this has only been demonstrated in animals.Sedatives: Theoretically, kava may have an additive effect with any centrally-acting medication that can potentially cause sedation Cytochrome P450 substrates: Kava inhibits CYP2E1 , 1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4 , and can affect the intracellular concentration of drugs metabolized by these enzymes. Another study shows Kava extracts can induce CYP2E1 and CYP1A2 in an animal model Acetaminophen: Kava enhances the hepatic cell-cytotoxicity induced by acetaminophen in vitro ",

Isoflavones, the major components of kudzu, are thought to be responsible for the beneficial effects.Kudzu demonstrated antiproliferative , anti-inflammatory , and neuroprotective  properties. It also has antiapoptotic effects against ethanol-induced apoptosis and suppresses alcohol intake \nSmall studies indicate benefits of kudzu in reducing alcohol intake in heavy drinkers . Data also indicate that it does not affect the sleep cycle of moderate drinkers . Kudzu may improve symptoms such as hot flushes and night sweats in perimenopausal women , and cognitive function in postmenopausal women . It may also be effective in preventing the development of gray hair \nHowever, because it has estrogenic effects , individuals with hormone-sensitive cancers and those taking tamoxifen should avoid kudzu.",

      "Mechanism of Action": "Isoflavones present in Pueraria mirifica are thought to be involved in alleviating symptoms such as hot flashes and night sweats in perimenopausal women  and affect cognitive function in postmenopausal women . The isoflavones present in the root extract suppress alcohol intake and alcohol withdrawal symptoms in mice although the mechanism is unclear . The anti-inflammatory property of kudzu is attributed to its ability to decrease prostaglandin E2 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha release, both of which are involved in inflammatory process . The flowers of Pueraria thunbergiana exhibit protective effects against ethanol-induced apoptosis in human neuroblastoma cells by inhibiting the expression of a protease, caspase-3 that is responsible for proteolytic cleavage of many proteins Peurarin may alleviate chronic alcoholic liver injury in rats via inhibition of endotoxin gut-leakage, activation of Kupffer cells, and expression of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) receptors Tectorigenin, an isoflavone present in kudzu, demonstrated antiproliferative activity against human cancer (HL-60) cells. The proposed mechanisms are induction of differentiation in the cells and a reduction in the expression of Bcl-2, an antiapoptotic protein ",

      "Clinical Summary": "L-theanine is a water soluble amino acid found in green tea and in mushrooms. Purified L-theanine is available as an oral dietary supplement. It is consumed for its perceived antioxidant and relaxant effects . Several in vitro and animal studies have shown that L-theanine has lipid-lowering , neuroprotective , antiobesity , and antitumor  properties. It can also affect the levels of some neurotransmitters , prevent beta-amyloid-induced cognitive dysfunction , and was shown to extend longevity in C. elegansWhen combined with antipsychotic treatment, L-theanine alleviated anxiety and other related symptoms, and improved sleep in patients with schizophrenia . In an open-label study of patients with major depressive disorder, L-theanine was safe and improved depressive symptoms, anxiety, sleep disturbance, and cognitive impairments Epidemiological data suggest its benefits with green tea for prevention of stroke , but it is unclear whether L-theanine contributed to this benefit. Small studies indicate that a combination of L-theanine and caffeine improves cognitive performance , although behavior improvements observed with caffeine alone were lost with concomitant caffeine and L-theanine supplementation . L-theanine may help improve sleep quality in boys with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) Theanine derivatives are currently being studied in models of human and mouse cancers for their inhibitory effects L-theanine enhances the chemotherapeutic effects of doxorubicin  and idarubicin , and alleviates adverse effects from use of these agents both in vitro and in animal models . However, patients undergoing chemotherapy should discuss the use of L-theanine with their physicians because these effects are not based on clinical trials, and epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) in green tea reduces activity of the chemotherapy drug bortezomib.",

      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "As a non-protein amino acid, L-theanine crosses the blood-brain barrier, exerting various neurophysiological and pharmacological effects including: anxiolytic and calming effects, due to inhibitory neurotransmitters and selective serotonin and dopamine modulation; cognitive improvements perhaps through decreased NMDA-dependent CA1 long-term potentiation (LTP) and increased NMDA-independent CA1-LTP; and improved selective attention during mental tasks likely due to changes in alpha brain wave activity . Neuroprotective effects are also thought to be due to its selective binding to glutamate receptors In animal models, L-theanine appears to have a dose-dependent biphasic effect on NSAID-induced gastric ulcers, delaying healing at higher doses (40 mg/kg), but accelerating healing at lower doses (10 mg/kg) perhaps through the maintenance of glutathione levels thus protecting against oxidative damage In human studies, L-theanine attenuated effects of caffeine on oxygenated hemoglobin, cognition, and mood, suggesting both independent and interactive effects between the two compounds . Other studies suggest that combining caffeine and theanine intake causes their individual effects to counteract each other . L-theanine also stabilizes glutamatergic concentrations in the brain, which may explain its therapeutic effect in patients with schizophrenia L-theanine was shown to increase the antitumor activity of chemotherapeutic drugs doxorubicin and idarubicin . These agents normally bind the glutamate receptor and the complex is transported across the cell resulting in reduced concentrations, hence attenuating effects of these drugs. Consequent mechanistic studies revealed that L-theanine, a glutamate analogue, competes with glutamate to bind the glutamate receptor, resulting in suppression of chemotherapy efflux (extracellular transport), increasing their concentration Interestingly, L-theanine also reduces the adverse effects of doxorubicin. The proposed mechanism is based on the variance of glutamate receptors expressed in normal and tumor cells. Whereas theanine binds the glutamate receptor in tumor cells, it is metabolized to glutamate in normal cells. This increase in glutamate likely results in increased efflux of doxorubicin from the cells, thereby decreasing toxicity Animal models indicate the prevention of doxorubicin-induced acute hepatotoxicity occurs through suppression of intrinsic caspase-3-dependent apoptotic signaling . L-theanine does not induce or inhibit cytochrome P450 enzymes Some novel theanine derivatives were found to inhibit lung tumor growth by targeting EGFR/VEGFR-Akt/NF-kappaB pathways ",

      "Scientific Name": "Lavandula angustifolia",
      "Clinical Summary": "Derived from the flowering tops of the plant, lavender oil is used in lotions and perfumes, in aromatherapy, as a topical treatment, and as an oral supplement for a wide variety of symptoms.Laboratory studies suggest that lavender has anxiolytic , anticonvulsant , neuroprotective , cardioprotective , antimicrobial , anti-inflammatory , and antioxidant  effects. Lavender oil inhalation reversed spatial memory loss in dementia models In human studies, benefits have been shown with oral lavender preparations for depression  and anxiety Lavender aromatherapy improved preoperative anxiety , and decreased postoperative analgesics  and autonomic response to pain . It also reduced pain and anxiety in burn patients , and pain from labor  or renal colic . Other studies have found benefit with inhaled lavender to improve sleep quality , post-acute-stress memory and physiologic function , dysmenorrhea and emotional symptoms , and menopause flushing . It reduced migraine frequency , and agitation and falls in older individuals . Inhaled lavender also improved dementia symptoms , whereas dermally-applied lavender did not . In addition, it was not found to be effective for fatigue in hemodialysis patients In studies evaluating effects on cancer symptoms, inhaled lavender did not reduce anxiety during radiotherapy , or increase benefits of massage . In other studies of lavender used in aromatherapy massage, it is unclear whether or not the benefits weren’t fully attributable to massage Lavender has demonstrated some activity in various cancer cell lines . Early animal studies of the monocyclic terpene perillyl alcohol (POH) derived from several herbs including lavender suggest tumor inhibition and regression Lavender has estrogenic activity. There are reports that prolonged use can cause gynecomastia in prepubertal boys ",

      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "Anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects of lavender are attributed to the constituent 1,8-cineole . Other dominant constituents include linalool and linalyl acetate, which may relax blood vessels and induce anxiolytic effects Lavender oil has broad-spectrum antibacterial activity . It reversed bacterial resistance to piperacillin in multi-drug-resistant E.coli via alterations of outer membrane permeability and bacterial quorum sensing inhibition , and prevented immediate-type allergic reactions by inhibiting mast cell degranulation . Antimicrobial activity was synergistic or additive when combined with other essential oils, with the most favorable combinations being cinnamon or sweet orange oil against C. albicans and S. aureus, respectively Data indicate lavender has depressive effects on the central nervous system . In animal models, it displays neuroprotective effects by attenuating neuronal damage, upregulating catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities, and the glutathione (GSH)/glutathione disulfide (GSSG) ratio . Activity in stroke models include increased endogenous antioxidant defense, oxidative stress inhibition, and increased vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression . In an Alzheimer’s disease model, lavender extract improved spatial performance by diminishing beta-amyloid production in the hippocampus . In mice with anosmia, anxiolytic effects with lavender inhalation were likely due to serotonergic mechanisms rather than olfactory activation . However, whether lavender alleviates or exacerbates anxiety may actually be determined by genetic influences on temperament, as these behaviors were respectively amplified after exposure to lavender inhalation in calm versus nervous sheep . Antiepileptic effects are due to suppression of nitric oxide level in the brain . Cardioprotective effects against myocardial infarction are attributed to its antioxidant properties . In wound healing models, lavender oil accelerates reepithelialization and wound closure via enhanced epidermal growth factor (EGF) secretion In young women with premenstrual syndrome, lavender inhalation increased the high frequency component of heart rate variability, reflecting parasympathetic nervous system activity . Although lavender reduced anxiety during urodynamic assessments by increasing c-aminobutyric acid inhibitory effects in the amygdala, blood pressure increases were attributed to potential diuretic activity . A positron emission tomography study revealed anxiolytic effects may occur via reduced serotonin-1A receptor binding . Effects on preoperative anxiety were attributed to both the use of lavender aroma as well as the placebo effect of added attention to patients Lavender has a high rate of antiradical activity among essential oils . An aqueous lavender extract inhibited lymphocyte proliferation in Hodgkin’s lymphoma cell lines via apoptosis . Lavender extracts and essential oil exhibit cytotoxicity to malignant cells, upregulate Bax expression, and induce PARP cleavage in HeLa cells, and cause a sub-G1 peak in treated cells compared with controls Perillyl alcohol (POH) derived from botanicals including lavender, may affect transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta and/or Ras signaling pathways  and Na/K-ATPase inhibition Lavender oil has weak estrogenic and antiandrogenic activities that may alter estrogen and androgen signaling pathways ",

It is widely used as a flavoring agent in Asian cuisine, in perfumery, and as an insect repellent. Lemongrass has also been traditionally used in folk medicine to treat anxiety, gastrointestinal problems, and to induce sleep. These effects have mostly been shown in animal studies. Lab studies showed that lemongrass can lower blood pressure, and has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anticancer properties. More research is needed to confirm such effects in humans.",

Her rash also came back after she drank lemongrass tea.",
      "Scientific Name": "Cymbopogon citratus, Cymbopogon flexuosus",
      "Clinical Summary": "The genus Cymbopogon consists of several lemongrass species  that are prevalent in the tropical regions of Africa and Asia,  including C. citratus (West Indian) and C. flexuosus (East Indian). Lemongrass is widely used as a flavoring agent in Asian cuisine, in perfumery, and as an insect repellent . It has been used in folk medicine as a sedative , to reduce gastrointestinal problems , and for its central nervous system-depressant effects . It is traditionally consumed as a tea and used in aromatherapy.In vitro, lemongrass exhibits antimicrobial , antibiofilm , anti-inflammatory , neuroprotective , vasorelaxant , and antidiabetic effects . Lemongrass extracts and constituents have shown antioxidant, antiproliferative, and apoptotic activity . Animal models also suggest anticancer , anti-inflammatory , anti-allergic , and anxyolitic activity , as well as protective effects on various organ systems In human pilot studies, lemongrass essential oil formulations were a helpful adjunct to periodontal therapy for patients with chronic periodontitis  and helped reduce oral thrush in HIV-positive patients . Lemongrass demonstrated antifungal activity against pityriasis versicolor, but was not as effective as ketoconazole In other studies evaluating lemongrass tea consumption, erythropoiesis-boosting effects were observed, suggesting possible uses in the treatment or prevention of anemia . However, lemongrass tea may also produce dose- and time-dependent adverse effects on renal function . Other studies have not found lemongrass tea ingestion to reduce anxiety or to benefit sleep . However, brief inhalation of lemongrass essential oil may help to accelerate recovery from some types of anxiety compared with controls . More studies are needed to confirm this effect.Although lemongrass and its constituents induced apoptosis in some cancer cell lines , they have not been studied in cancer patients.",
      "Food Sources": "Lemongrass is used to flavor many foods and beverages. The dried leaves are used to make tea.",
      "Purported Uses2": [

        "Anti-inflammatory",
        "Antimicrobial",
        "Anxiolytic",
        "Sedative",
        "Vasorelaxation"
      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "Chlorogenic acid, isoorientin, and swertiajaponin were identified as the active constituents in lemongrass that possess antioxidant properties to prevent endothelial dysfunction via a nitric oxide-independent vasodilatador effect on blood vessels . In vitro, anti-inflammatory effects of lemongrass occur through inhibition of IL-1beta , and proteasome and nuclear factor-kappaB pathways by chlorogenic acid . In rat cerebellar granule neuron cultures, neuroprotective effects were attributed to antiapoptotic activity that occurred with cell cycle arrest in the G0G1 phase In animal models, anti-allergic and anti-inflammatory effects were attributed to the major constituents citral and geranial . The anti-inflammatory effects of citral were further attributed to PPAR-gamma activation . Lemongrass inhibits release of the inflammation marker myeloperoxidase from neutrophils and suppresses IL-6 and IL-1alpha production in mice peritoneal macrophages . A lemongrass hexane extract modulated allergic asthma via inhibition of nuclear factor kappa B activation . Analgesic effects by the constituent citronellol are attributed to inhibition of peripheral mediators as well as central inhibitory mechanisms . Anxiolytic activity of lemongrass appeared to be mediated by the GABAergic system . It also altered onset and duration of convulsions and potentiated sleep time through GABAergic mechanisms , and increased seizure threshold by blocking seizure propagation In humans, the erythropoiesis-boosting effects produced with lemongrass tea consumption are likely due to its nutritional constituents and antioxidant and pharmacologic properties . As aromatherapy to revert reactive anxiety, lemongrass essential oil appears to act through the olfactory or nose-to-brain pathways to restore homeostasis Several constituents in lemongrass demonstrate anticancer activity. Isointermedeol upregulates tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 leading to apoptosis through the extrinsic Fas pathway . It also increases mitochondrial expression and activation of caspase-9 via the intrinsic cell death pathway. Citral induced apoptosis via caspase-3 enzymatic activity in human leukemia and breast cancer cells , and induced glutathione S-transferase (GST) through an electrophilic interaction with glutathione in rat liver epithelial cells. GST functions in cell detoxification by rescuing cells from oxidative damage and carcinogenic compounds . Cytotoxicity was attributed to the presence of an unsaturated aldehyde group, which is specific to the geranial isomer of citral . Polysaccharides from lemongrass produced cytotoxic and apoptotic effects in cervical and prostate carcinoma cells via caspase 3 upregulation and Bcl-2 downregulation followed by cytochrome c release , and antitumor and immunomodulatory activities in sarcoma-180 tumor cells were attributed to immunoenhancement rather than direct cytotoxicity ",
      "Contraindications": [
        "Because of its antioxidant potential, lemongrass may interfere with the actions of some chemotherapeutic agents.",
        "Lemongrass should be avoided during pregnancy as high doses of citral and myrcene caused birth defects in rats"
      ],
      "Adverse Reactions": "Oral: Dizziness, drowsiness, dry mouth, excessive urination, and increased appetite In high doses, the essential oil of C. citratus can damage liver and stomach mucosae . Excessive ingestion of lemongrass tea may also have adverse effects on renal function Topical: Contact dermatitis Case report Delayed contact dermatitis (topical and oral): In a 52-year-old massage therapist who also practiced aromatherapy with essential oils including lemongrass.

      "Clinical Summary": "Lentinan, a polysaccharide, is derived from the mycelium of the shiitake mushroom body, and its active component is 1,3 beta glucan. In some countries, parenteral lentinan is classified as an antineoplastic polysaccharide and is available for clinical use. Only oral formulations and extracts, which are considered dietary supplements, are available for use in the United States.Although lentinan is a biological response modifier, it does not have a direct cytotoxic effect on tumor cells . In various cancer models, lentinan has also been shown to enhance activity of gemcitabine , paclitaxel , docetaxel and cisplatin , and monoclonal antibodies . Addition of lentinan to standard cancer therapies, considered chemoimmunotherapy , resulted in improved survival in hepatocellular  and gastric  cancers, and improved quality of life in patients with esophageal carcinoma Improvements in quality of life were also seen with an oral formulation of lentinan in some cancer patients . However, well-designed large-scale studies are needed to establish the role of lentinan as a useful adjunct to cancer treatment.",

      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "Lentinan’s active polysaccharide, 1,3 beta glucan, is not cytotoxic but seems to enhance T-helper cell function and increase stimulation of interleukin, interferon, and normal killer cells . In addition to their primary structures, immunopotentiation activity of beta-D-glucans is linked to their molecular weight and triple helical conformation, which varied greatly between batches and manufacturers In vivo studies suggest that 1,3 beta glucan increases IL-4-producing cells, suggesting a stimulation of Th2-mediated immunity . In addition to antitumor activity, lentinan also possesses immune-regulatory effects, antiviral activity, antimicrobial properties, and cholesterol-lowering effects In murine bone marrow cells, lentinan enhanced repair of paclitaxel-induced DNA damage and protected against paclitaxel-induced apoptosis partly via modulation of cellular antioxidant levels . Lentinan also was shown to induce apoptosis in gastric cancer cells, and this effect was enhanced when combined with docetaxel and cisplatin . In urothelial bladder cancer cell lines, increased concentrations of lentinan alone or combined with gemcitabine correlated with enhanced T24 cell apoptosis . Lentinan cotreatment with paclitaxel enhanced effects in a lung cancer cell line through ROS production and activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and ASK1/p38 MAPK signal pathway ",
      "Contraindications": "Prior reactions to lentinan from shiitake mushroom ingestion ",
      "Adverse Reactions": "Side effects with lentinan infusions are mainly mild, with more severe reactions (anaphylactoid reaction, back pain, leg pain, depression, rigor, fever, chills, granulocytopenia and elevated liver enzymes) related to short infusion times Case Reports Chest tightness: Following parenteral injection of lentinan Shiitake dermatitis (rash): Patterns of whiplike, linear, erythematous wheals within 1 to 2 days after consumption of raw or even cooked shiitake mushrooms caused by toxic reactions to lentinan, which typically resolve within days to weeks of their appearance ",

      "Scientific Name": "2-Amino-4-methylpentanoic acid",
      "Clinical Summary": "Leucine is an essential amino acid that is not synthesized in the human body and must be obtained from food consisting of plant or animal protein. Leucine is often used together with valine and isoleucine, which are branched-chain amino acids (BCAA), in parenteral forms for nutritional support to maintain nitrogen balance, and to treat cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy.Purified leucine is marketed as a dietary supplement for body building. It is thought to stimulate protein synthesis by activating the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway . In various animal models, leucine supplementation improved leptin sensitivity , lipid and glucose metabolism , exercise tolerance  , acquired growth hormone resistance , disease-related skeletal muscle dysfunctions , and anemia An oral leucine-enriched BCAA mixture increased muscle protein synthesis and reversed sarcopenic processes in cirrhotic patients . However, leucine supplementation alone did not have additional effects on exercise capacity, muscle mass or quality of life when compared with exercise plus leucine supplementation . Leucine did not affect glycemic control in elderly diabetic men , but in healthy subjects and in the presence of glucose, stimulated insulin secretion and lowered blood glucose levels Studies with leucine supplementation and exercise show some benefits in older populations. A leucine-rich essential amino acid mixture along with exercise significantly improved muscle mass and strength, and walking speed in community-dwelling sarcopenic women . Leucine-enriched whey protein nutritional supplements improved sarcopenia in older and older-obese adults . Another study evaluating combined resistance training with high-dose leucine supplementation in older adults suggests moderate benefit on muscle strength and functional status In athletes, dietary supplementation with leucine can improve performance  and upper body strength . However, two double-blind RCTs in younger active populations, one of resistance training along with powdered leucine/protein shakes in young men , and another evaluating a postsurgical rehabilitation program along with leucine supplementation among athletes  did not find improvements attributable to leucine, although it appeared to promote thigh muscle recovery in the latter study Findings from systematic reviews are mixed. In older sarcopenia-prone individuals leucine supplementation may improve body weight, body mass index, and lean body mass, but not muscle strength . Another review concluded that although central leucine injection decreased food intake, this effect was not well reproduced with oral leucine, even though it improved glucose homeostasis . Well designed longer-term studies are needed to determine optimal supplementation with leucine across these varied populations.Leucine from dietary sources is generally considered safe. However, excessive intake may result in hypoglycemia  and may also cause vitamin B3 and B6 deficiencies . Amounts exceeding ∼39 g/d may pose a health risk . Animal pancreatic cancer models suggest that it may also increase growth of pancreatic tumors ",

      "Mechanism of Action": "Leucine is among the essential branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) associated with skeletal muscle growth and maintenance, energy production, and generation of neurotransmitter and gluconeogenic precursors . It stimulates protein synthesis by activating the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway  and is thought to enhance muscle anabolic signaling Animal models indicate that BCAA metabolism-related gene expression is regulated during adipocyte differentiation and influenced by nutrient levels, and leucine supplementation induced Bcat2 and Bckdha genes during early and late differentiation . It improved insulin sensitivity in high-fat diet-fed mice by decreasing adiposity, rather than through direct action on peripheral target organs . Leucine supplementation also improved lipid and glucose metabolism and restored leptin sensitivity in previously obese animals . At the same time, in already-obese rats, leucine supplementation worsened adiposity by encouraging hypothalamic gene expression that favored fat accumulation . In another animal study, it did not reduce food intake or induce an anorectic pattern of hypothalamic gene expression . Co-ingested leucine and glycine markedly attenuated glucose response, with only a modest increase in insulin response, suggesting their effects on glucose metabolism are partially insulin-independent . Leucine along with subtherapeutic levels of a PDE5 inhibitor altered lipid metabolism from storage to oxidation, improved glycemic control, and reversed hepatic steatosis induced by high-fat feeding Leucine supplementation speeds connective tissue repair and muscle regeneration by attenuating transforming growth factor-beta type I receptor and activating Smad2/3 . Antiatrophic effects were not mediated by its metabolite, beta-hydroxy-beta-methyl butyrate, and did not occur in dexamethasone-treated rats The ability of leucine to improve anemia in ribosomal protein-deficient cells occurs independently of TP53 . In Diamond-Blackfan anemia patients, leucine modulates protein synthesis by enhancing translation leading to improved hemoglobin levels . In the skeletal muscle of cirrhotic patients, an oral leucine-enriched BCAA mixture increased autophagy and reversed impaired mTOR1 signaling ",

Experiments in animals and humans show licorice can mimic the effects of steroid hormones such as aldosterone and estrogen. The substance in licorice that scientists think is responsible for these effects is called glycyrrhizin. However, because glycyrrhizin causes undesirable side effects, it is often removed from licorice products during processing.\nPhysiologic activity has also been reported for several other compounds in licorice. Isoflavone compounds also mimic estrogens in the human body, and can kill several strains of bacteria and viruses on contact. Other compounds act as blood thinners and inhibit inflammation. In humans, the compound, carbenoxolone, has been used to treat stomach and esophageal ulcers with positive effects. Scientists think that it increases blood flow to and amount of mucus lining the stomach.",

      "Special Point": "Due to the adverse reaction profile of licorice, many studies have been performed using the deglycyrrhizinated licorice (DGL) extract that is free of glycyrrhizin.",
      "Scientific Name": "Glycyrrhiza glabra, Glycyrrhiza uralensis",
      "Clinical Summary": "Derived from the root of the plant, licorice has been used as a flavoring and sweetening agent. This herb is an important component of traditional Chinese medicine used to detoxify and enhance or balance the effects of other components in herbal formulas; and as a tonic, expectorant and a demulcent in Ayurveda. A number of compounds including glycyrrhizin are thought to be responsible for its biologic effects.In vitro and animal studies show that licorice has antibacterial , antiviral , anticancer , anti-inflammatory , and hepatoprotective  properties. Licorice also demonstrated estrogenic effects , reduced cardiotoxicity associated with doxorubicin , and improved the antitumor effects of cyclophosphamide . However, these effects have not been confirmed in humans.\nClinical data suggest utility of licorice in lowering dyspepsia  and hyperlipidemia , and concurrent intake of a glycyrrhizin-containing product during alcohol consumption was shown to afford hepatoprotection . In another study, preoperative gargling with licorice solution affected significant reductions in postoperative sore throat when compared to gargling with sugar water . Licorice solution was also reported to improve xerostomia in hemodialysis patients ; and had comparable efficacy as triamcinolone in the management of oral mucositis during radiotherapy . But chronic ingestion of even moderate doses of licorice has been associated with hypertension and hypokalemia ",

        "Peptic ulcers",
        "Primary adrenocortical insufficiency",
        "Prostate cancer"
      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "Glycyrrhizin, one of the bioactive compounds of licorice, has been shown to bind to glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptors, and exert its effects via inhibition of 11b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase . Licorice can reduce serum testosterone by inhibiting 17-hydroxysteriod dehydrogenase . It also contains isoflavones and other constituents that have estrogen receptor-modulating activities . The flavone and liquiritigenin components selectively activate ER-alpha Liquiritigenin was also shown to have neuroprotective effects in scopolamine-induced mice likely via increasing expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and cAMP response element binding (CREB) in the hippocampus . In addition, glycyrrhizic acid, a triterpene glycoside, demonstrated anti-allerigic property by restoring the immune balance of subsets 1 and 2 of T helper cells in a dose-dependent manner. It also siginificantly reduced B cells producing allergen-specific IgE and IgGIn other studies, licorice demonstrated chemo-preventive effects by modulating expression of Bcl-2/Bax proteins, which act as apoptotic regulatory factors ; and via inhibiting carcinogenesis . The most common side effect of licorice is hypokalemic hypertension, which occurs secondary to inhibition of 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, a renal enzyme responsible for converting cortisol to cortisone. This inhibition results in enhancing the mineralocorticoid effects of cortisol  that include sodium retention and excretion of potassium.",
      "Warnings": "Due to the adverse reaction profile of licorice, many studies have been performed using the deglycyrrhizinated licorice (DGL) extract that is free of glycyrrhizin.",
      "Adverse Reactions": "Hypertension , lethargy, muscle pain, sodium retention, hypokalemia , adrenal crisis , ventricular fibrillation , cardiac arrythmias , carpal tunnel syndrome , glycyrrhizic acid poisoning , leukoderma , and thrombocytopenia have been reported following ingestion of licorice or licorice containing products.",
      "Herb-Drug Interactions": "Cardiac glycosides: Licorice may potentiate toxicity Diuretics: Licorice may increase the risk of hypokalemia Insulin: Licorice may increase insulin sensitivity Anticoagulants: Licorice may increase the metabolism and clearance of warfarin MAO-inhibitors (MAOIs): Licorice may potentiate activity of MAOIs P-Glycoprotein (P-gp) substrates: Licorice inhibited P-gp, resulting in increased intracellular concentration of the chemotherapy agent daunorubicin, which is a substrate of P-gp Cytochrome P450 substrates: Glycyrrhizin, a major constituent of licorice, induces CYP3A  and CYP2D6 , and can affect the intracellular concentration of drugs metabolized by this enzyme. However, other constituents, like glabridin, glycycoumarin and licochalcone A from different species of licorice can inhibit these enzymes Cyclosporine: Licorice greatly reduced the oral bioavailability of cyclosporine by activating P-gp and CYP3A4 Cortisol acetate: Licorice increased cortisol availability in tissues in the hours following oral cortisone acetate administration Metformin:  Pre-administration of licorice juice reduced the efficacy of metformin, in a rat model . The clinical relevance in humans has yet to be determined.",

      "Mechanism of Action": "Ligustrum lucidum is thought to exert antitumor properties by modulating immune response and by reverting macrophage suppression brought about by tumors . Another in vitro study has shown that such effects may also be due to increases in phagocytes and lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells . The secoiridoid glucosides in Ligustrum fruit showed strong antioxidant effect against free radical-associated hemolysis of erythrocytes . One of the secoiridoid glucosides, oleuropein, also demonstrated significant antiviral activity against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and parainfluenza type 3 virus (Para 3) although the mechanism is not known . The hepatoprotective effects of Ligustrum are due to the oleanolic acid and are thought to be mediated by an increase in hepatic glutathione regeneration capacity ",

      "How It Works": "Livingston-Wheeler therapy has not been shown to treat cancer.\nLivingston-Wheeler therapy is an alternative approach to cancer treatment that gained popularity from the 1970s to early 1990. It used several treatments to supposedly stimulate the immune system, including BCG vaccine and a vaccine made from the individual’s own urine, a strict vegetarian diet, antioxidants, and detoxification via coffee enemas. Treatments were available at a clinic run by Virginia Livingston-Wheeler, a doctor who believed that cancer was caused by a bacterium called Progenitor cryptocides, which she claimed to have isolated from cancer tissues. Although a number of viruses and bacteria have been associated with various cancers, a link between the bacteria named by Livingston-Wheeler and cancer was never confirmed by independent researchers.Experts have studied the strict vegetarian diets required by metabolic therapies like Livingston-Wheeler, and have concluded that they are deficient in important nutrients such as calcium, iron, vitamins D, vitamin B12, and protein. Such diets would be unsuitable for some cancer patients.",
      "Purported Uses": [
        [
          "To treat cancer",
          "One study found similar survival rates between patients treated with the Livingston-Wheeler therapy and with conventional cancer therapies at a major hospital, but the patients using the Livingston-Wheeler therapy had more side effects and lower quality of life.

        "In a 1990 position paper, the American Cancer Society urged cancer patients not to use these treatments, as no evidence supported their safety or effectiveness. In addition, although the Livingston-Wheeler diet was similar to recommendations made by the American Cancer Society, its nutrient deficits, especially for calcium, iron, vitamins D and B12, and protein, would be unsuitable for some cancer patients."

      "Clinical Summary": "Livingston-Wheeler Therapy is an alternative approach to cancer treatment that gained popularity from the 1970s to early 1990. It used several treatments to supposedly stimulate the immune system, including a strict vegetarian diet, BCG vaccine, coffee enemas, autogenous vaccine, vitamins, antibiotics, antioxidants, nutritional counseling, and support groups/counseling. The regimen was based on the theory that cancer was caused by the bacterium Progenitor cryptocides, which developer Virginia Livingston-Wheeler reported to have isolated in a wide variety of cancer tissues . A weakened immune system would then allow the bacterium to grow, and consequently the therapy’s focus was immune-stimulation. Although a number of viruses and bacteria have been associated with various cancers , a link between the bacteria named by Livingston-Wheeler and cancer was never confirmed by independent researchers.A self-selected, matched-cohort, prospective comparison of patients at Livingston-Wheeler Clinic and a conventional cancer center found no difference in survival times between groups, but did find consistently lower quality of life in the Livingston-Wheeler cohort Metabolic diets may result in nutrient deficiencies . Repeated use of coffee enemas has been linked to several deaths from serious infection and electrolyte imbalance . In a 1990 position paper, the American Cancer Society urged cancer patients not to use these treatments ",

      "How It Works": "Current evidence shows that lobelia is not effective for smoking cessation, asthma, or any other medical condition.\nThe active compound in lobelia is lobeline. Lobeline has a similar activity in the body to nicotine, which explains its common use as an aid in smoking cessation. Like nicotine, lobelia stimulates the central nervous system (CNS), dilates lung passageways, and increases respiration rate. However, at higher doses, lobelia has the opposite effect and causes CNS depression and reduced breathing rate. In experiments with rats and mice, lobeline increased the release of stimulatory neurotransmitters dopamine and norepinephrine from specific parts of the brain, but it is still unclear what significance this has in the human body. Strangely, lobeline can have both additive and opposing effects when used at the same time as nicotine.",

      "Clinical Summary": "Derived from the aerial parts of the plant, patients use lobelia for smoking cessation and to treat asthma and depression. Piperidine alkaloids are thought responsible for lobelia’s activity. In vitro and animal studies show that lobeline crosses the blood-brain barrier, has activity similar to that of nicotine, and stimulates the release of dopamine and norepinephrine . At low doses lobelia has stimulant effects, but higher doses result in CNS depression Lobeline, a piperidine alkaloid, was shown to reverse multidrug resistance of tumor cells to doxorubicin , reduce alcohol consumption , and exert antidepressant effects  in mice.\nClinical studies of lobelia do not support its use for smoking cessation  ",

      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "Lobelia has central stimulant activity, dilates bronchioles, and increases respiration rate at low doses, but higher doses cause CNS and respiratory depression In vitro, lobeline redistributes dopamine pools in presynaptic vesicles and antagonizes their release following amphetamine stimulation. Lobeline can have both antagonistic and synergistic effects when combined with nicotine and does not induce receptor upregulation as seen with nicotine In rodent models, lobeline increases dopamine release from striatal synaptosomes, increases norepinephrine release from the hippocampus , and binds extensively to nicotinic receptors both centrally and peripherally . Other animal studies suggest that beta-amyrin palmitate stimulates the release of norepinephrine in the brain, possibly leading to an antidepressant effect Intravenous administration of approximately 12 mcg/kg lobeline to healthy human subjects resulted in cough, apnea, prolonged inspiration and expiratory pause, the feeling of choking, and pressure in the throat and chest ",

      "How It Works": "Current evidence is not sufficient to know if lutein is useful in preventing macular degeneration or cataracts. A diet containing lutein-rich vegetables and fruits may lower the risk of some cancers.\nLutein is a natural pigment synthesized by plants and microorganisms. Because it is an antioxidant, cancer prevention activity has been proposed, but no studies have proved this. Scientists also think that lutein may stimulate the immune system, stop DNA from mutating, or stop the growth of pre-cancerous cells. Lutein has been associated with a decreased risk of macular degeneration and cataracts, but there is not enough evidence to draw definite conclusions. There is some early evidence that increased lutein levels in the blood may protect against heart disease, but more studies are needed.",

      "Clinical Summary": "Lutein is a natural carotenoid pigment synthesized by plants and microorganisms. Carotenoids are classified as either provitamin A (alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, and beta-cryptoxanthin, which can be converted into retinol) or nonprovitamin A (lutein, lycopene, and zeaxanthin). Lutein has antioxidant  and anti-inflammatory  activities, and supplements are marketed as protection against ocular diseases such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and for general eye health.Dietary lutein may protect against DNA damage but this may be due to concomitant intake of other micronutrients . However, preliminary evidence suggests that supplemental lutein may reduce biomarkers for coronary vascular disease (CVD) in healthy nonsmokers , and increase serum lutein in patients with early atherosclerosis, thereby regulating serum lipids and reducing inflammatory cytokines Epidemiologic studies also suggest an association between increased lutein consumption and decreased incidence of atherosclerosis  and cataracts , although the effects of dietary lutein on macular degeneration are inconsistent . Other long-term studies found no effects with lutein/zeaxanthin supplementation on cognitive function , or risk for cataract surgery or vision loss Preliminary studies suggest lutein supplementation may increase plasma lutein concentrations and physical activity in sedentary older adults . It may also improve visual field in patients with retinitis pigmentosa . Other studies show increased macular pigment optical density (MPOD) with lutein-containing supplements in patients with Alzheimer’s disease , but not in healthy volunteers  or offspring of parents with neovascular AMD . Although lutein/zeaxanthin improved retinal function in patients with early AMD , the current evidence is insufficient to support its use  Increased lutein consumption may decrease the risk of renal cell carcinoma , nonaggressive urothelial cell carcinoma , and breast cancer . Data on the effects of dietary lutein intake and risk of cervical or colon cancer are conflicting , whereas no association was found between lutein and lung cancer risk  or prostate cancer risk ",
      "Food Sources": "Kale, spinach, winter squash, cruciferous vegetables, cabbage, green beans, yellow/orange fruits, mangoes, papayas, peaches, oranges Lutein is absorbed best with meals that are higher in fat.",

      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "Lutein is one of the predominant carotenoids that accumulates in both the lens and retinal macula . It scavenges reactive oxygen species, preventing damage to DNA and protein molecules . As an oxycarotenoid, its structure is less hydrophobic than beta-carotene and lycopene. This enables lutein to react with free radicals in a membrane’s aqueous phase, resulting in increased membrane integrity, which may in turn affect tissue permeability to oxygen and other molecules . It may also protect against ocular damage by reducing the amount of blue light that reaches photoreceptors As a nonprovitamin A carotenoid, lutein does not have any vitamin A activity, but does have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immune-enhancing properties. In an obese rat model, lutein independently reduced superoxide dismutase activity, and also raised glutathione peroxidase activity in lean rats when combined with ascorbic acid . In vitro and atherosclerotic mouse models demonstrate the ability of lutein to inhibit monocyte inflammatory responses to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) in the artery wall and reduce monocyte migration . In humans, lutein supplementation decreases lipid peroxidation and inflammatory response Carotenoids including lutein inhibit mutagenesis and transformation, and premalignant lesions . In murine mammary cancer models, dietary lutein selectively modulated apoptosis and inhibited angiogenesis by increasing p53 and Bax proapoptotic gene expression, while decreasing Bcl-2 antiapoptotic gene expression with a subsequent increase in Bax:Bcl-2 ratio in tumors . Lutein-mediated AP-1 suppression and anti-inflammatory effects are due to its antioxidative and p38/c-Jun-N-terminal kinase inhibitory activities . In a hepatocellular carcinoma animal model, lutein reduced γ-glutamyl transpeptidase activity, a marker of cellular proliferation ",

      "Clinical Summary": "The berries of Lycium barbarum are used in traditional medicine to treat inflammation, skin irritations, nose bleeds, aches, and pains and as a sedative . Lycium is also commonly used with other botanicals in Chinese medicine for poor vision, anemia, and cough . A polysaccharide isolated from lycium was shown to have antitumor , immune-enhancing  and neuroprotective  properties in vitro. It also showed radiosensitizing , hepatoprotective  and photoprotective  effects in mice.Small studies of lycium reported subjective improvement in well-being in healthy subjects , and its protective effects on macula in elderly subjects by preventing hypopigmentation \nLycium was shown to inhibit growth of ER-positive breast cancer cells . Data from an observational study done in China suggest that polysaccharides from Lycium barbarum have beneficial effects when used with certain cancer treatments . It is unclear if similar effects can be observed with cancer treatments that are currently in use. In another study lycium was shown to reduce cardiotoxicity associated with doxorubicin . Well-designed clinical trials are needed to determine lycium’s anticancer potential.Despite many marketing claims of cancer preventive potential, the efficacy and safety of lycium products for cancer treatment have not been established.",

      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "The bark and berries contain betasitosterol which can prevent cholesterol absorption in the gastrointestinal tract . The hepatoprotective effects of Lycium barbarum polysaccharide (LBP) are in part via modulation of transcription factor NF-κB and MAPK pathways and autophagy . In another study, LBP was shown to act as a novel antioxidant against insulin resistance induced by a high-fat diet through activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2, (PI3K/AKT/Nrf2) pathway . It also exerts protective effects against focal cerebral ischemic injury by attenuating the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway \nLBP may have anticancer potential. It was shown to inhibit the growth of leukemia HL-60 cells  and increase expression of interleukin-2 and tumor necrosis factor alpha . The antiproliferative effects of  LBP are via activation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) ",

      "How It Works": "Diets that contain many fruits and vegetables rich in carotenoids like lycopene can help prevent some types of cancers and heart problems. However, not enough research has been done to say whether lycopene supplements have the same effect.\nLycopene is a natural pigment that is produced by plants and microorganisms. Laboratory experiments with lycopene confirm that it acts as an antioxidant and affects the way cells grow and communicate with each other, although it is not as potent as beta-carotene. Scientists have proposed several different mechanisms by which lycopene might fight cancer. These include stopping cancer cell growth, preventing DNA damage, and enhancing enzymes that break down cancer-causing products. Studies in healthy elderly patients suggest that consumption of lycopene or tomato juice does not stimulate the immune system. In general, diets rich in carotenoids like lycopene have been associated with decreased risk of macular degeneration, cataracts, some types of cancers, and some heart problems.",

      ],
      "Patient Warnings": "Negative interactions between chronic alcohol ingestion and lycopene supplementation have been demonstrated and suggest a need for caution among individuals consuming high amounts of both alcohol and lycopene.",
      "Side Effects": [
        "After long-term ingestion of large quantities of lycopene-rich foods (i.e. tomato products), some individuals may develop lycopenaemia, a deep orange discoloration of the skin",
        "Laboratory studies demonstrate a possible interaction between high-dose lycopene and chronic alcohol consumption."
      ],
      "Special Point": "An analysis of six commercially available brands revealed that lycopene content varied from the labeled dosage by as much as 43%.",
      "Clinical Summary": "A natural pigment synthesized by plants and microorganisms, lycopene is used primarily as an antioxidant and also to prevent and treat cancer, heart disease, and macular degeneration. Lycopene is classified as a non-provitamin A carotenoid, other examples being lutein and zeaxanthin. Alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, and beta-cryptoxanthin are classified as provitamin A carotenoids because they can be converted into retinol.Small clinical trials suggest possible benefit against exercise-induced asthma  and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) . However, no optimal dosage has been established. Data from observational studies indicate an inverse association of lycopene consumption with risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) ; with a randomized study reporting improvements in endothelial function in CVD patients, but not in healthy volunteers \nLycopene was also shown to enhance antitumor efficacy of docetaxel against prostate cancer in animal models .  And epidemiologic studies suggest an inverse relationship between lycopene consumption and risk of cancer , particularly lung , stomach , prostate , estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR)-positive breast cancer . A consistent association between lycopene consumption and endometrial cancer risk has yet to be reported However, clinical data on the effects of lycopene supplementation for prevention of prostate cancer remain inconclusive. Whereas low intake of tomato sauce is thought to be associated with advanced prostate cancer in patients with low-grade cancer at diagnosis , data from other studies indicate that lycopene or tomato-based regimens do not prevent prostate cancer \nIn men with high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN), a lycopene-rich extract did not confer any benefits ; and high doses of lycopene, green tea catechins and selenium were actually associated with higher incidence of prostate cancer . Also, variable results were reported for lycopene supplementation in prostate cancer patients . Further studies are needed to resolve this ambiguity.\nQuality control is a concern as shown by an analysis of six commercially available brands which revealed that lycopene content varied from the labeled dosage by as much as 43% ",

      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "Lycopene is a natural pigment synthesized by plants and microorganisms. Referred to as a nonprovitamin A carotenoid, it is not known to have any vitamin A activity. Biological actions include antioxidant activity via singlet oxygen quenching and peroxyl radical scavenging, induction of cell to cell communication, and growth control, although this appears to occur with less efficiency than with beta-carotene . Preventive consumption of lycopene was shown to attenuate the effects of acetaminophen-induced liver injury in a murine model Proposed mechanisms of cancer preventive effects include inhibition of cancer growth, induction of differentiation by modulation of cell cycle regulatory proteins, alterations in insulin-like growth factor-1  or vascular endothelial growth factor  levels, prevention of oxidative DNA damage, and possible enhancement of carcinogen metabolizing enzymes . The anti-metastatic action of lycopene was reported, in human liver adenocarcinoma cell model, to be via down-regulation of NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4), which produces reactive oxygen species Other possible actions for all carotenoids include immune enhancement, inhibition of mutagenesis and transformation, and inhibition of premalignant lesions. Carotenoids have also been associated with decreased risk of macular degeneration and cataracts, decreased risk for some types of cancers, and decreased risk of some cardiovascular events ",

      "Scientific Name": "Lepidium meyenii, Lepidium peruvianum ",
      "Clinical Summary": "Maca is a nutritionally valuable plant native to Peru that grows in harsh climates above 4,000 feet. It has been used traditionally to enhance fertility and sexual performance in both men and women and to relieve menopausal symptoms . Maca has also been purported to treat cancer and to improve stamina in cancer patients.In vitro, maca or its constituents have demonstrated antiviral , antioxidant , anti-inflammatory, analgesic, or neuroprotective  activities.Animal studies indicate that maca increases endurance , enhances sexual function , and improves scopolamine-induced memory deficits . It also demonstrated antidepressant  and postmenopausal hormone-modulating  effects.Only a few small trials have evaluated maca for its effects in humans. Maca consumption was associated with lower serum IL-6 levels and higher health status . In men, maca supplementation increased libido , sperm production and motility , and enhanced subjective sexual well-being . Another preliminary study suggests it may also improve athletic performance . In women, several studies suggest that maca improves both antidepressant- and menopause-induced sexual dysfunction . A study in Chinese postmenopausal women showed neither hormonal nor immunological effects, but did appear to reduce depressive symptoms and diastolic blood pressure . However, systematic reviews have deemed the evidence on maca for sexual dysfunction  or for alleviating menopausal symptoms  to be limited and requiring further research. Another review indicates that maca is not an effective anti-aging agent A case report showed maca may interfere with testosterone immunoassays ",
      "Purported Uses2": [

        "Menopausal symptoms",
        "Sexual performance",
        "Strength and stamina",
        "Cancer treatment"
      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "Maca contains glucosinolates, mostly benzylglucosinolate, along with hydroxy or methoxylated benzyl derivatives and tryptophan-derived compounds, and depending on the phenotype (red, yellow, purple or black) may be associated different biological effects In vitro, both methanolic and aqueous extracts of maca exhibit estrogenic activity . A methanol maca extract demonstrated antiviral activity against Flu-A and Flu-B viruses . An isolated N‑alkylamide from maca root was found to possess both direct and indirect cannabimimetic actions . Maca polysaccharides demonstrated radical scavenging activity . Macamides, normally not present in fresh plants but introduced during traditional drying practices , are fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) inhibitors, and act on the central nervous system by modulating the release of neurotransmitters . Antidepressant-like effects were associated with activation of both noradrenergic and dopaminergic systems and attenuation of oxidative stress In animal models, maca powder derived from tubers enhanced serum luteinizing hormone (LH) levels in female rats during the proestrus LH surge in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting it may enhance fertility . In postmenopausal models, maca modulates hormone levels particularly by decreasing follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels In humans, although maca does not affect serum levels of LH, FSH, prolactin, testosterone, or estradiol in men , it appears to modulate some hormone levels in women in some studies  but not others . Increased LH and decreased FSH that corresponded with improved sexual functioning in postmenopausal women are potentially attributed to a negative feedback loop, resulting in increased androgen production . It may also exert androgenic effects at the testosterone receptor on target organs without affecting testosterone or gonadotrophin levels . At the same time, the benefits of maca for antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction in women may be more a function of advancing age rather than menopausal status, as there was no correlation with estrogen levels ",
      "Adverse Reactions": "Subjective reports of altered menstrual cycles, moodiness, cramps, gastritis, and insomnia Flu-like symptoms and vomiting report were reported in one clinical study. However, it is unclear if these were caused by maca Case reportProlonged intermenstrual bleeding and markedly elevated total plasma testosterone: In a white female in her thirties from ingesting maca powder 1 tsp daily dissolved in milk to improve energy levels and libido ",

      "Clinical Summary": "Magnesium is an essential mineral involved in numerous biochemical processes, including adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production, cellular signal transduction, DNA, RNA and protein synthesis, and bone formation . It also helps regulate blood pressure and enzymes such as those that control intracellular calcium and potassium, and is essential for normal heart functioning . The dietary form can be found in many foods, and especially in dark green leafy vegetables, nuts, legumes, whole grains, fruits, and fish In dietary supplements, other over-the-counter products, and pharmaceutical preparations, magnesium is combined with another substance such as a salt or acid, and has specific therapeutic uses. The carbonate, hydroxide, and oxide forms are found in antacid and laxative products whereas citrate is used as a laxative before diagnostic procedures or surgery of the colon. The chloride, gluconate, lactate, and sulfate forms are clinically used to treat magnesium deficiency.Both dietary and supplemental forms have been studied widely for their potential role in chronic ailments such as heart disease and diabetes. Dietary intake is associated with reduced mortality from cardiovascular disease, especially for women . It is also associated with reduced risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD), although studies have been mixed and more affirmative for the effect of serum magnesium on SCD . It may help reduce the risk of ischemic stroke , metabolic syndrome , type 2 diabetes  and insulin resistance , asthma , and osteoporosis , but findings from studies on depression are conflicting . Other studies also have not linked dietary consumption with cancer incidence and mortality , or pancreatic cancer risk , but have associated higher intake with a lower risk for colorectal tumors  and lung cancer . Additional studies are needed to confirm these effects.Magnesium supplementation has been evaluated for a variety of health conditions. Oral intake may increase survival in patients with heart failure , and improve insulin sensitivity in healthy adults , and in those with diabetes . In a study of overweight individuals, supplementation resulted in changes in gene expression and other positive effects on metabolic pathways . Some studies have shown a reduction in blood pressure following supplementation , but an earlier systematic review suggests the positive findings are due to poor trial design and short duration . Also in contrast, data from a large, community-based cohort did not show low serum levels to be a risk factor for developing hypertension or cardiovascular disease Other studies of oral supplements have demonstrated positive effects on bone mass accrual in healthy adolescents with inadequate intake , and suppressed bone turnover in postmenopausal osteoporotic women . In adults with asthma, supplementation improved objective measures of airway resistance and subjective measures of asthma control and quality of life ; in pediatric patients with cystic fibrosis, it has improved respiratory muscle strength . There is also moderate evidence for its use in migraine headache and prophylaxis . Although preliminary data have shown mixed results with oral supplementation for premenstrual syndrome , a pilot study indicates that it reduces menopausal hot flashes in breast cancer patients , and a systematic review supports its use for leg cramps during pregnancy . Larger studies are needed to elucidate conflicting results and clarify the roles for supplementation across various health conditions.Many adults, particularly African-Americans  and the elderly , may not have adequate dietary intakes of magnesium. However, true deficiency most often occurs with critical illness including cardiac conditions and preeclampsia, as well as gastrointestinal and renal conditions, poorly-controlled diabetes, and alcoholism . In addition, certain medications including calcineurin inhibitors , high-dose antivirals , and the long-term use of proton pump inhibitors , as well as some cancer therapy regimens  and surgical procedures , may also cause hypomagnesemia. If deficiency is suspected, patients should be evaluated by their treating physician to determine the extent of inadequate intake and its effective management, as well as to avoid potential drug interactions or magnesium toxicity.Hypermagnesemia is rare and results from failure to excrete magnesium or because of excessive intake. It may especially occur in patients with gastrointestinal or renal dysfunction, and have serious effects such as hypotension, bradycardia, depression of tendon reflexes, and other cardiovascular and neuromuscular manifestations ",

      "Mechanism of Action": "Magnesium plays a significant role in vascular and metabolic biology as well as numerous biochemical reactions. It negatively regulates vascular calcification and osteogenic differentiation through an increase or restoration of transient receptor potential melastatin 7 (TRPM7) activity and increased expression of anticalcification proteins, in vitro . It also influences blood pressure levels through interactions with the renin-angiotensin system, by acting as a calcium channel blocker to reduce vascular resistance, and by modulating vascular tone and reactivity . Further, it contributes to the homeostasis of electrolytes in cells via sodium-potassium pump activation  and can revert impaired intracellular ion homeostasis As a cofactor of all reactions involving ATP transfer, magnesium is a major determinant of insulin and glucose metabolism, critical to carbohydrate metabolism, and regulates the activity of all enzymes involved in phosphorylation reactions . These vascular and metabolic mechanisms are echoed by observed relationships between deficiency and oxidative stress, proinflammatory states, endothelial dysfunction, platelet aggregation, insulin resistance, and hyperglycemia . A possible mechanism of cardiovascular benefits may be via a reduction in arterial stiffness Magnesium can also serve an immunomodulatory function by regulating NF-kB activation and cytokine production, and limiting systemic inflammation . It also reduces markers for systemic inflammation and endothelial dysfunction including C-reactive protein . Its salts are poorly absorbed, and act as an osmotic laxative by retaining water in the intestine. The mechanism by which it may affect the bioavailability of concomitantly administered drugs is through the formation of insoluble chelate complexes with those drugs, substantially reducing their bioavailability Experimental and epidemiological evidence for the role of magnesium in cancer is conflicting. Its part in cellular metabolism and maintaining genetic stability, regulation of cell proliferation, and protection against insulin resistance, oxidative stress, and systemic inflammation are also cancer-preventive attributes . At the same time, hypomagnesemia as a side effect of some cancer treatments may produce an inhibitory effect on tumor growth and neo-angiogenesis, but magnesium levels are also increased in tumors both in vivo and in vitro, suggesting its multiple and possibly dichotomous roles in cancer ",
      "Contraindications": "Individuals with other heart, kidney, or gastrointestinal disorders , should not take magnesium supplements without a doctor’s supervision.",

      "Herb-Drug Interactions": "Aminoglycosides: Can cause renal magnesium wasting and subsequent deficiency Antibiotics: Magnesium or antacids may reduce the absorption of fluoroquinolones, tetracyclines, and nitrofurantoin. Magnesium-containing products, if needed, should be taken in accordance with the prescribing information of these antibacterials Anticoagulants: Magnesium or antacids can increase rate and extent of absorption Antidiabetics: Magnesium or antacids can increase rate and extent of absorption of sulphonylurea drugs Antifungals: Magnesium or antacids may reduce the rate and extent of itraconazole absorption Antimicrobials (pentamidine): Can cause renal magnesium wasting and subsequent deficiency Antivirals (ribavirin): High-dose antivirals may cause hypomagnesemia Bisphosphonates: Calcium/magnesium levels may be affected in patients receiving bisphosphonate therapy . In addition, antacids may interfere with absorption of bisphosphonates Calcineurin inhibitors: May cause hypomagnesemia Calcium channel blockers: Magnesium may potentiate blood pressure-lowering effects Cisplatin-based chemotherapy: May cause hypomagnesemia Dasatinib: May increase blood levels of magnesium Digoxin: Digoxin reduces tubular magnesium reabsorption. In patients with congestive heart failure effects may be cumulative with diuretics, diet, and poor intestinal absorption. Hypomagnesemia may increase adverse effects such as palpitations and nausea with digoxin. Magnesium and other electrolyte levels should be monitored in patients treated with cardiovascular drugs Diuretics: Loop and thiazide diuretics are electrolyte-depleting, and can cause renal magnesium wasting and subsequent deficiency . Cumulative effects with other cardiovascular drugs may occur (see Digoxin entry).Monoclonal antibodies (cetuximab, panitumumab): These cancer drugs target the epidermal-growth-factor receptor and hypomagnesemia is a frequent side effect . Electrolytes are monitored during and following treatment, and appropriate treatment instituted Neuromuscular blockers: Magnesium supplements may potentiate the effects of neuromuscular blockers used in clinical settings Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: Antacids can increase rate and extent of absorption Proton pump inhibitors: Long-term use may cause hypomagnesemia Synthetic thyroid hormone: Two case reports of magnesium-containing antacids/laxatives reduced the effectiveness of levothyroxine ",

      "How It Works": "Magnetic therapies have no role in the diagnosis or treatment of cancer. Clinical trials do not support the use of magnets to relieve pain.\nThe term “magnet therapy” encompasses practices as simple as wearing magnetized bracelets, to using magnetized mattresses, to therapy that involves large magnetic field-generating machinery. People have different theories for why magnets might have an effect upon the body, but they all generally claim that magnets act upon the body’s molecules, ions, or “energy field” to correct disruptions. So far, there is no scientific support for this idea.Physics tell us that an unchanging magnetic field will change the direction in which charged molecules called ions move. Ions such as calcium and potassium are extremely important for cell signaling and nerve transmission in the body. However, even though laboratory experiments show that strong static magnetic fields might be able to alter the activity of ions in isolated cells, we still have no proof that these magnetic fields will do the same in the complex setting of the human body, or that this will have a clinically meaningful effect. In addition, a group of researchers have tested several magnetized products and found that many did not deliver as high of a magnetic field as they claimed, much less the amount needed to see effects that occur in laboratory studies.\nThere is no scientific logic to the idea that magnets can cure cancer, and this effect has never been seen in humans. Most anecdotes of magnetic “healing” involve symptoms that may be psychosomatic, associated with stress, or subjective measures such as pain or depression.",

      "Clinical Summary": "Magnet therapy is an alternative therapy available in clinics in Mexico, Germany, and elsewhere. Magnetic therapies are promoted to diagnose and treat cancer, HIV, psychiatric disorders, stress, multiple sclerosis, and infections, and to increase energy, prolong life, and stimulate the immune system. Magnetic fields are administered by application of magnets to certain parts of the body, by magnetic field-generating machines, or with magnetic mattresses or blankets. Treatment can last minutes to weeks. Evidence supporting the use of magnetic therapies for the above conditions are limited. State consumer protection agencies and the FDA have prosecuted various marketers of magnetized devices and therapies, forcing them to halt unsubstantiated claims of health benefits.\nIn vitro studies show that static magnetic fields may modulate ion transport and related cell and neuronal activity , but the physiological significance of these findings is unknown. No anticancer activity has been demonstrated. Patients also use magnetized braces and mattresses to treat pain associated with fibromyalgia, diabetic neuropathy, sciatica, and arthritis. Clinical studies of these devices are small and flawed. Although some show improvements in pain associated with conditions such as diabetic neuropathy , fibromyalgia , and arthritis , results are often indistinguishable from placebo effects.Body magnets are contraindicated in radiology and/or magnetic resonance (MR) procedures. Patients with a cardiac pacemaker and pregnant women should also avoid use of magnetic devices. Magnetic therapies have no role in the diagnosis or treatment of cancer.",

      "Mechanism of Action": "Marketers make varying unsubstantiated claims for how magnets work, such as: magnets “act upon the body’s energy field,” or correct “magnetic field deficiency syndrome,”  a condition said to result from decreases in the earth’s magnetic field over the past 1,000 years. It is purported that the positive (south) pole of the magnet has a “stress effect,” which interferes with metabolic functioning, produces acidity, reduces cellular oxygen supply, and encourages the replication of latent microorganisms. The negative (north) pole is said to have a “calming effect” and helps to normalize metabolic functioning, promote oxygenation, and treat neurological/psychiatric disorders. No evidence supports these claims, and no anticancer activity is seen for magnetic fields in laboratory or human studies. Most anecdotes of magnetic “healing” involve symptoms that may be psychosomatic, associated with stress, or subjective measures such as pain or depression \nTheoretically, static magnetic fields (SMFs) may alter ion flow, cellular potential, membrane configuration, ion pump activity, or neurotransmitter release . Most of the biological phenomena associated with SMFs may be caused by changes in cellular calcium . SMFs of 1,000-4,000 G are found to alter protein and enzyme structure and the kinetics of reactions involving free radicals . Reduced action potential firing in cultured neurons and permeability changes in synthetic liposome vesicles are observed after application of a SMF . It may not be legitimate to extrapolate in vitro data in which cells are directly exposed to magnetic fields, to their effect in a complex biological system. Moreover, many in vitro studies have not been replicated. Although some authors refer to documented effects of pulsed electromagnetic fields in attempting to explain a mechanism of action for static magnets, SMFs do not generate an electric field and therefore cannot confer the claimed physiologic effects . It is suggested that positive reports of magnet use reflect placebo effects.",
      "Contraindications": [
        "Patients with a cardiac pacemaker and pregnant women should avoid use of magnetic devices."
      ],
      "Adverse Reactions": "Pain, nausea, and dizziness; symptoms ceased upon removal of the magnets Case Report\nBullous pemphigoid associated with magnetic mattress use Regular use of low-intensity magnets appears to be safe. The World Health Organization reports that the available evidence indicates the absence of adverse effects on human health with exposure to magnetic fields up to 2 Tesla (20,000 G) ",

      "Scientific Name": "Magnolia officinalis",
      "Clinical Summary": "Magnolia officinalis is an oriental flowering herb that has been used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat anxiety, depression, stress, nervousness, and sleep-related problems. The tree bark contains the active constituents magnolol and honokiol.In vitro and in vivo studies suggest these compounds have antimicrobial , anti-inflammatory  , antidiabetic , antidepressant , anxiolytic , and neuroprotective  effects. Preclinical studies have evaluated their anticancer potential. Magnolol demonstrated activity against a variety of cancers, including bladder , prostate , colorectal , breast , and lung  cancers . Honokiol also showed antitumor and antiangiogenic effects  in leukemia , lung , bladder , prostate , melanoma , breast , glioblastoma , neuroblastoma , and oral cancer  cells lines. Other animal studies suggest honokiol may enhance low-dose docetaxel treatment against prostate cancer growth and bone metastasis A few preliminary studies have been conducted in humans, and showed benefits for vasomotor symptoms , weight management , and oral health , but these studies were performed in combination with other compounds. There are no clinical trials conducted in humans to evaluate magnolia bark extract for its cancer preventive properties.Magnolia bark extract and its constituents may inhibit several enzymes or pathways by which many drugs are metabolized, including cytochrome P450 (CYP450), UDP- glucuronosyltransferase (UGT), and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) expression . Therefore, there is the potential for interactions with many medications.",

      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "In THP-1 cells, magnolol and honokiol reduced inflammatory TNF-α and interleukin-8 (IL-8) production induced by Propionibacterium acnes . Other anti-inflammatory markers reduced by magnolia bark extract include IL-6 as well as matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) and MMP9  . Antihyperglycemic effects with magnolia bark extract are attributed to the inhibition of protein tyrosine phosphatase enzyme 1B, a negative regulator of the insulin signaling pathway, which increases ERK phosphorylation and GLUt4 translocation . Magnolol increased both insulin-stimulated glucose transport and production of GLUT1 and GLUT4 mRNA, and GLUT4 protein A combination of honokiol and magnolol normalized biochemical abnormalities in brain 5-HT and 5-HIAA, serum corticosterone levels, and platelet adenylyl cyclase activity, a biomarker for depression in chronically stressed rodents . Anxiolytic effects of honokiol are attributed to its selective stimulation of GABA-A receptors or its binding to anxiety-related sites A number of anticancer mechanisms have been identified with magnolol. In human bladder cancer cells, it induced p27KIP1-mediated G2/M-phase cell cycle arrest to activate the extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway , and decreased the binding of transcription factor NF-kappaB to DNA to inhibit MMP9 expression . In prostate cancer cells, magnolol affected the expression of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and associated binding proteins , inhibited the EGFR/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway , and downregulated MMP2 and MMP9 protein and mRNA levels . Antitumor activity also occurred via MMP9 inhibition through the NF-kappaB pathway in breast cancer cells  and through AMPK activation in colorectal cancer cells Antitumor and antiangiogenic properties of honokiol are attributed to nuclear factor kappa beta (NF-kB) inhibition and the consequent scavenging of reactive oxygen species . In human endothelial cells, honokiol inhibited vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) phosphorylation . It also blocked VEGF-induced Rac to prevent migration of malignant endothelial cells , blocked signaling pathways in tumor cells with defective p53 , and suppressed NF-kB overactivity . In acute myeloid leukemia cells, honokiol inhibited STAT3 signaling via increased protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP1 expression . In glioma cells, it induced autophagy and activated a p53/cyclin D1/CDK6/CDK4/E2F1-dependent pathway to induce apoptosis and cell cycle arrest  and in prostate cancer cells, honokiol suppressed c-Myc protein expression In animal models of prostate cancer with bone metastasis, honokiol induced apoptosis via caspase-3,-8, and -9 activation and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage . As a potential P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitor, constituents of magnolia bark extract may reduce multi-drug resistance in cancer cells via P-gp downregulation ",

      "How It Works": "Maitake demonstrated anticancer effects in laboratory studies. Research is underway to test its anticancer effects in humans.\nMaitake is a mushroom that traditionally has been used in Japan and China as part of the diet and to treat diabetes and hypertension. Like other medicinal mushrooms, maitake contains a complex sugar called beta-glucan. In laboratory and human studies, maitake extract was able to stimulate various cells and factors in the immune system. Studies in animals show that it slows the growth of certain tumors and lowers blood sugar levels. More studies are being conducted to determine if maitake has the same effects in humans.",

      "Side Effects": " An increased number of white blood cells which may indicate an allergic reaction.",
      "Scientific Name": "Grifola frondosa",
      "Clinical Summary": "Maitake is an edible mushroom consumed widely in Asia as food and used in traditional medicine to treat diabetes and hypertension. Its extracts are commercially available as dietary supplements marketed to “enhance immune function” and to treat HIV and cancer. Beta 1,6-glucan, a protein bound polysaccharide, has been identified as the active constituent. Maitake extracts exhibited hypoglycemic effects in a few studies . Preliminary data also suggest that maitake may be useful in inducing ovulation in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome In other studies, maitake demonstrated antitumor effects , enhanced bone marrow colony formation, reduced doxorubicin toxicity , and inhibited tumor metastasis in vitro . In a study done in mice, an orally administered extract promoted maturation of hematopoietic cells to functionally active myeloid cells and enhanced peripheral blood leukocyte recovery following chemotoxic bone marrow injury . A novel polysaccharide, MZF, was shown to induce dendritic cell maturation and enhanced antitumor response . Maitake also enhanced interferon activity against bladder cancer cells  and alleviated inflammation associated with inflammatory bowel disease In a small non-controlled study, tumor regression or significant improvements in symptoms were observed in half of the subjects who took Maitake extract . In a trial of postmenopausal breast cancer patients, oral administration of a maitake extract was shown to have immunomodulatory effects ; and to enhance neutrophil and monocyte function in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome . More studies are underway to establish maitake’s anticancer potential.",
      "Food Sources": "Maitake mushroom is an edible fungus. The whole mushroom can be fried or boiled.",
      "Purported Uses2": [
        "Cancer prevention",
        "Diabetes",
        "High cholesterol",
        "Hypertension",
        "Immunostimulation",
        "Weight loss"
      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "Maitake is thought to exert its effects through its ability to activate various effector cells, such as macrophages, natural killer cells, and T cells, as well as interleukin-1 and superoxide anions . Studies also suggest possible hypoglycemic activity . The antidiabetic effect of alpha-glucan may be due to its effects on insulin receptors by increasing insulin sensitivity and ameliorating insulin resistance of peripheral target tissues Maitake extract enhanced the growth and differentiation of mouse bone marrow cells treated with doxorubicin, a chemotherapeutic agent . In addition, maitake extract may modulate antigen presentation as evidenced by protection of mice against tumor implantation following transfer of dendritic cells from tumor-bearing mice that were treated with maitake extract In other studies, maitake D fraction demonstrated antitumor activity by upregulating expression of a proapoptotic gene, BAK-1 ; and prevented breast carcinogenesis, blocked tumor invasiveness, reduced angiogenesis, and increased overall survival in a murine model . In addition, maitake polysaccharides were found to induce apoptosis GFPs induced via the mitochondrial-dependent apoptotic pathway in human breast cancer cells ; the beta glucan GFPBW1 also showed antitumor effects that are thought in part due to activation of macrophages via the Dectin-1/Syk/NF-κB signaling pathway ; and an orally administered maitake alpha-glucan was found to activate dendritic cells and macrophages in Peyer’s patches, resulting in induction of systemic antitumor T-cell response Maitake also exerted antidepressant effects in mice, involving activation of the α-Amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionic acid (AMPA) receptors, which are important mediators for the treatment of depression ",
      "Contraindications": "Maitake may not be appropriate for those taking hypoglycemic medications because it can have synergistic effects ",
      "Adverse Reactions": "Asymptomatic eosinophilia ",
      "Herb-Drug Interactions": "Warfarin: Maitake may interact with warfarin resulting in an elevated international normalized ratio (INR) Hypoglycemic medications: Maitake may increase their effects  ",
      "Herb Lab Interactions": "Maitake may lower blood glucose levels ",

The fruits are consumed as food but also used in traditional medicine to treat skin infections, wounds, and diarrhea. Mangosteen juice is marketed as a health drink and the pericarp, or fruit hull, can be found in many dietary supplements for their antioxidant activity. Preliminary evidence shows that xanthones from mangosteen exhibit antibacterial , antifungal , anti-inflammatory , antiatherosclerotic , anti-asthmatic , antiangiogenic , cytotoxic , aromatase-inhibitory , and anticancer  properties. They may also provide protection against doxorubicin-induced neurotoxicity  and cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity Small studies in humans suggest benefits with mangosteen-containing products as an adjunct for periodontal treatment  and for control of halitosis . An herbal formula containing mangosteen extract may be helpful in weight management , but confirmatory studies are needed.Mangosteen products may interfere with certain chemotherapeutic drugs. Patients with diabetes or ulcerative colitis should also avoid mangosteen due to high sugar content and hypothetical potential for exacerbation of symptoms, respectively.",

      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "Many compounds isolated from mangosteen fruit and pericarp have been used in lab studies. Xanthones alpha- and beta-mangostins and garcinone B exhibit strong inhibitory effects against Mycobacterium tuberculosis , as well as aromatase-inhibitor activity . Alpha- and gamma-mangostins act as histamine and serotonin receptor blockers  and inhibit HIV-1 protease . In animal models, they reduced major features of allergic asthma including airway inflammatory cell recruitment and hyperresponsiveness, increased Th2 cytokine levels, and attenuated increases in phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) activity, phosphorylation of Akt, and NF-kappaB . The ability of alpha-mangostin to inhibit fatty acid synthase may occur via stronger action on the ketoacyl synthase domain and weaker effects on the acetyl/malonyl transferase domain . It also reduced prostaglandin synthesis by inhibiting COX-1 and -2 enzyme activities , and prevented oxidative damage of LDL by functioning as a free-radical scavenger . The compound isogarcinol isolated from mangosteen induces anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressant effects in animal models . Mangosteen extract may have antiobesity effects by increasing AMP-activated protein kinase and Sirtuin 1 activities in the liver Chemopreventive properties of mangosteen xanthones against specific human cancer cell lines have also been demonstrated, including: alpha-mangostin in leukemia , breast , gastric , and pancreatic cancer cells ; gartanin in urinary bladder cancer ; and gamma-mangostin  and garcinone E  in liver cancer cells. Extracts from the pericarp of mangosteen also exhibit antioxidant , antiproliferative, and apoptotic effects The preventive effect of alpha-mangostin on cisplatin-induced apoptotic death is associated with the inhibition of p53 expression and generation of reactive oxygen species . Alpha-mangostin inhibited growth of leukemia HL60 cells by inducing caspase-3-dependent apoptosis . It reduced matrix metalloproteinase MMP-2 and -9 expression, increased E-cadherin expression, and suppressed the ERK signaling pathway in pancreatic cancer cell lines . In chronic myeloid leukemia cells, it induced autophagy via increased expression of the autophagosome marker LC-3II and accumulation of autophagic vacuoles, in addition to antiproliferative and apoptotic effects . Another study also attributes the antitumor activity of alpha-mangostin to autophagy and not endoplasmic reticulum stress induction Beta-mangostin decreased the proliferation of human cervical cancer HeLa cell by inhibiting cellular polymerases Gamma-Mangostin demonstrated free radical scavenging activity in human liver cancer cells In bladder cancer cell lines, activities of gartanin suggest mTOR pathway inhibition, downregulation of Bcl-2 expression, and p53 pathway activation leading to apoptotic induction ",
      "Contraindications": "Patients with ulcerative colitis should avoid products high in alpha-mangostin as animal studies suggest this constituent may actually exacerbate symptoms ",
      "Adverse Reactions": "Case Report: Severe lactic acidosis was reported following consumption of mangosteen juice daily for 12 months ",
      "Herb-Drug Interactions": "Chemotherapy: Mangosteen products have antioxidant effects  and may interfere with the action of anthracyclines, platinum compounds, and alkylating agents.Calcineurin inhibitors (cyclosporine, tacrolimus): Isogarcinol isolated from Garcinia mangostana inhibits calcineurin. It may have additive immunosuppressant effects if used with related drugs.Cytochrome P450 substrates: Mangosteen inhibits CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2E1 and CYP3A11 and can affect the intracellular concentration of drugs metabolized by these enzymes ",

      "How It Works": "Manuka honey (MH) helps prevent infections and promotes wound healing when used externally.\nMH can help fight bacterial infections and has been used in dressings to promote wound healing. Methylglyoxal, a compound present in MH, is thought to have bacteriostatic effects. In vitro and animal studies have shown that MH has anti-inflammatory and anti-ulcer effects. Small studies in humans suggest its benefits against gingivitis and inflamed nasal sinuses.

      "Patient Warnings": "Although MH has antibacterial effects, patients should not self-medicate with honey products. Any infection should be examined by a physician or a qualified healthcare professional for proper care.",

        "The sugar content in honey may raise the blood glucose level of diabetics.",
        "In rodents, a 50% concentration of MH applied to the ear following a surgical procedure of the eardrum resulting in inflammation leading to facial paralysis and hearing loss."
      ],
      "Clinical Summary": "Manuka honey (MH) is collected from beehives around the Manuka (Leptospermum scoparium) bush that is indigenous to Australia and New Zealand. It has been used as food and as a topical treatment for wounds, burns and ulcers. Studies done in vitro and in animal models show that MH has antibacterial , anti-inflammatory , antioxidant and anti-ulcer  effects. Methylglyoxal, one of the constituents, is the major bactericidal factor . MH was also found effective against several antibiotic-resistant bacteria , and may potentially be useful against rapidly increasing antibiotic resistance.Small studies suggest its utility against gingivitis , chronic rhinosinusitis , as an adjunct in the management of corneal oedema , and as an adjunctive oral hygiene agent in children . However, randomized trials did not find MH to be more effective compared to standard treatments against catheter-associated bacterial infections , in healing venous leg ulcers  or eyelid surgical wounds . MH has also been used to increase levels of beneficial bacteria and relieve gastrointestinal problems, but was not found useful in healthy subjects . It also did not reduce cholesterol levels in subjects with hypercholesterolemia The anticancer potential of MH has not been investigated yet. But it was ineffective in alleviating radiation-induced oral mucositis in randomized trials involving patients with head and neck cancer , although one study reported a reduction in bacterial infections . Larger studies are needed to determine the therapeutic value of MH.",

        "Oral health"
      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "Flavonoids present in MH demonstrated anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and anticancer properties . Methylglyoxal, a phytochemical, is the major bactericidal factor and also promotes free radical generation . MH was shown to reduce the motility of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a gram negative bacterium and an opportunistic pathogen, by suppressing genes associated with its flagella, thereby reducing its virulence . It also inhibited the formation of biofilm, a complex polysaccharide structure produced by some bacteria such as Clostridium dificile, which confers on them resistance to antibiotics . The anti-ulcer effects of MH are likely by increasing gastric mucosal levels of glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase; and by reducing inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha), Interleukins 1-beta and 6 In addition, MH honey was shown to enhance the effects of antioxidants in animal studies  as well as promote wound healing by modulating production of cytokines  and by lowering pH on wound surfaces . Some products MH list its antibacterial potency by a Unique Manuka Factor (UMF), which is equal to the inhibitory potential of a phenolic solution of same strength . However, the clinical relevance of this measurement is unclear.",
      "Contraindications": "Individuals allergic to honey should avoid this product.",
      "Adverse Reactions": [
        "May increase blood glucose levels.",
        "In a rodent model, a 50% concentration of MH applied to the ear following myringotomy caused severe inflammation leading to facial paralysis, vestibulotoxicity, and hearing loss"
      ],
      "Herb-Drug Interactions": "Chemotherapy: Theoretically, MH may interfere with certain chemotherapeutic agents due to its antioxidant effects.",

      "How It Works": "Massage is effective in reducing symptoms associated with cancer such as pain and anxiety.It can also improve shortness of breath, fatigue, and sleep quality, and be helpful for constipation and phantom pain. \nMassage helps reduce muscle soreness, stiffness, and spasms. It also promotes relaxation and improves circulation, processes that can support recovery and healing. There are many styles of massage including Swedishreflexologyreikineuromuscular therapymyofascial releaseshiatsutui na, and manual lymphatic drainage, or MLDSwedish massage is the most common and consists of five basic strokes. Reflexology involves massaging specific areas on the hands or feet that correspond to other parts of the body. Reiki promotes the healing of physical and emotional ailments through gentle touch. Neuromuscular therapy uses pressure and friction to relieve areas of strain or trigger points. Myofascial release uses gentle sustained pressure to connective tissue to release muscular tightness and soreness. Shiatsu and tui na are techniques that started in Asia. They are used to stimulate energy and blood flow in acupuncture points and channels. MLD uses a light rhythmic technique that encourages the natural movement of lymph fluid throughout the body.Clinical trials have shown that massage therapy helps reduce pain, anxiety, fatigue, and shortness of breath in cancer patients. It can ease the mind, improve sleep, reduce depression, and provide comfort to patients. It may also help children and caregivers. In addition, studies suggest that massage can reduce pain and anxiety related to medical procedures, including surgery. Certain types of massage, such as reflexology, are better suited for hospital or clinic settings, or in weak and elderly patients.Massage is increasingly used with standard therapies for patients suffering from cancer and other diseases. However, patients should speak with their doctor and see a qualified massage therapist who understands their condition for treatment.The Integrative Medicine Service at MSK offers many of these therapies to support the recovery and wellbeing of cancer patients.",

      "Clinical Summary": "Massage is an ancient technique that involves manual manipulation of muscles and soft tissues of the body. It increases circulation and promotes relaxation. In addition, it has important emotional and psychological benefits. The various forms of massage that are commonly practiced include Swedish massagereflexologyreikineuromuscular therapymyofascial releaseshiatsutui na, and manual lymphatic drainage, or MLDSwedish massage is the most common and consists of five basic strokes and their variations. Reflexology involves massaging reflex points on the hands, feet, or ears that correspond to particular regions in the body. It is utilized frequently and effectively for nausea, constipation, and peripheral neuropathy in the acute setting. Reiki promotes the healing of physical and emotional ailments through gentle touch. Shiatsu and tui na originated in Japan and China, and involve manual stimulation of acupuncture points and meridians to ensure proper flow of energy and blood to facilitate healing. Neuromuscular therapy uses pressure and friction to relieve areas of strain or trigger points.Myofascial release applies gentle sustained pressure to connective tissue to release muscular tightness and soreness. MLD uses a light rhythmic technique that encourages the natural movement of lymph fluid throughout the body.In cancer patients, clinical studies show that massage can alleviate symptoms such as stress, anxiety, nausea, insomnia, pain, fatigue, and depression , and reduce neurological complications . Swedish massage can relieve persistent fatigue in breast cancer survivors . Reflexology was also found to alleviate pain and nausea  and reduce anxiety , dyspnea, and fatigue in cancer patients . Both massage therapy alone and in combination with meditation appeared to help post-operative breast cancer patients . Gentle abdominal massage was found to improve depression, anxiety, wellbeing, and perceived abdominal bloating in cancer patients with malignant ascites . Preliminary data indicate that postoperative arm massage can decrease pain and discomfort after lymph node dissection . Manual lymphatic drainage reduced lymphedema  and prevented secondary lymphedema  in breast cancer patients.Massage has also shown some benefits for pediatric cancer patients and caregivers. In a study of hospitalized adolescents with cancer, massage was well-received with trends towards increased nighttime and overall sleep . In family caregivers of patients with cancer, it reduced anxiety, cortisol levels, blood pressure, and pulse rate, and improved sleep quality Some studies show that massage and reflexology sessions have benefit and clinical utility, particularly for pain or anxiety associated with surgery and procedural interventions Massage therapy is also effective in treating chronic back pain , osteoarthritis of the knee , neck pain , headaches , and to reduce blood pressure . Both aromatherapy massage and inhalation aromatherapy reduced anxiety and pain in burn patients . In HIV patients, massage improved pain, anxiety, and hyperventilation . Reflexology reduced anxiety, labor pain, and duration among first-time mothers Self-care massage has also been found to improve mental health and blood pressure  and reduce stress  in some populations.Clinical trials are evaluating massage therapy for conditions such as peripheral neuropathy, preoperatively for breast surgery patients, and combined with music therapy for hospice patients. A trial is also underway to determine whether massage can facilitate stroke recovery Massage is generally safe and increasingly used as a complementary therapy to provide relief from certain symptoms of cancer and other illnesses. However, patients suffering from cancer, heart disease, or arthritis should consult a qualified massage therapist for treatment.The Integrative Medicine Service at MSK offers many of these therapies to support the recovery and wellbeing of cancer patients.",

      "Scientific Name": "Ilex paraguariensis",
      "Clinical Summary": "Mate is a plant native to South America. It is widely consumed as a hot beverage known as chimarrão, and is also used in traditional medicine. Mate is valued for its stimulatory effects and promoted as a dietary supplement for weight loss, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer prevention.Mate demonstrated antioxidant activity  and cardioprotective effects  in vitro. Obese and hyperlipidemic animal models also suggest antiadipogenic and antilipidemic effects . A product containing mate was found to delay gastric emptying , and preliminary studies in generally healthy women suggest consumption may have short-term effects on caloric intake and appetite regulation . Long-term consumption of mate tea was also weakly associated with better bone health in postmenopausal women , but clinical studies are needed to confirm such effects.In various cancer models, constituents of mate exhibited proteasome  and topoisomerase  inhibitory properties, as well as anti-inflammatory and apoptotic effects . However, no large-scale clinical studies have evaluated the safety and efficacy of mate in humans. Further, epidemiologic data indicate that chronic mate drinkers are at an increased risk of prostate , bladder , esophageal , lung , and head and neck cancers . This risk appears to be additive when combined with chronic alcohol or tobacco use . Evidence also suggests that drinking very hot mate contributes to its carcicogenic effects ",

        "Headaches",
        "Promote urination",
        "Weight loss"
      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "In vitro studies indicate that antioxidant and antimicrobial activity of mate may be due to its polyphenolic content , while cardioprotective effects occur through the regulation of nitric oxide .  Caffeine, theophylline, and theobromine are the xanthines in mate largely responsible for its stimulatory effects In animal models, mate regulates adipogenesis through the Wnt pathway , reduces lipid peroxidation, improves endothelial function and LPL and HL activities, and modulates lipogenic gene expression . Thermogenic properties have been related to enhanced expression of uncoupling proteins, while increased fatty acid oxidation is linked to AMPK phosphorylation in visceral adipose tissue Anticancer activities of mate extract can occur through proteasome  and topoisomerase  inhibition. It also reduced DNA damage from oxidative stress . In human colon cancer cells, saponins and phenolics in mate demonstrate antiinflammatory activity and induce apoptosis through caspase activation . However, other carcinogenic constituents in mate and high temperatures used for brewing could facilitate their solubility and absorption  and thus explain associated increased cancer risks.",
      "Warnings": "High doses and prolonged consumption of mate tea are associated with an increased risk of various cancers . Concomitant long-term alcohol or tobacco use further increases this risk ",
      "Contraindications": [
        "Patients with hypertension, cardiac disorders, and anxiety should not consume mate",

Caffeine and theobromine were detected in high concentrations across various maternal and neonatal samples including breast milk and neonatal urine and hair. Symptoms progressively disappeared by 84 hours of age. However, intermittent irritability was still present at 24 days when the newborn was discharged. Considerable, progressive, and constant reduction of mate consumption to a maximum of 2 cups per day for the duration of breastfeeding was advised ",

      "Clinical Summary": "The Mediterranean diet is consumed in regions that border the Mediterranean Sea. Epidemiological studies show that it contributes to better health and overall quality of life. It is also an established model of eating for primary and secondary prevention of various chronic diseases. The Mediterranean diet consists of a variety of fruits, vegetables, cereals, legumes, poultry, fish, nuts, seeds, olive oil, and moderate intake of red wine with meals . Olive oil, a monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA), comprises 15% to 20% as the major source of dietary fats in this diet . Another hallmark is the low consumption of meat and dairy products Epidemiological analyses suggest that over 90% of type 2 diabetes, 80% of coronary heart disease, and 70% of stroke can be avoided by adopting healthful food choices that model the traditional Mediterranean diet Although there were no significant associations with reduced bladder cancer risk , other large prospective studies found that adherence to the Mediterranean diet resulted in significant reductions for hip fracture incidence , risk of sudden cardiac death , gastric adenocarcinoma incidence  , modest reductions in colorectal cancer risk , and overall reduction in cancer risk . A randomized controlled trial demonstrated that a Mediterranean diet can reduce the risk of cardiovascular  events . Conclusions of various meta-analyses also indicate associations between greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet and significant reductions in weight gain  as well as risk factors for diabetes and cardiovascular diseases , overall mortality, cancer incidence and mortality, and incidence of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease . Results from PREDIMED, the largest long-term randomized trial in Spain examining disease and mortality outcomes with the Mediterranean diet, also confirm these findings . Moreover, secondary analyses of PREDIMED suggests that a Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil confers benefits in the prevention of breast cancer , and improves atheroprotective functioning of high-density lipoproteins for individuals at high risk for cardiovascular disease . Other studies suggest it can reduce systolic blood pressure, improve endothelial functioning , and protect against macular degeneration Interestingly, a large cross-sectional study identified certain factors that improved adherence to the Mediterranean diet, including female sex, older age, higher levels of physical activity, and moderate alcohol consumption, while poorer adherence was associated with males and obesity . However, these results may not be translatable to the general public and may be unique to the culture of the Spanish populations studied.Cancer patients may have special nutritional needs and should consult a dietician before changing diet. Alcohol consumption can increase the risk of certain cancers ",
      "Food Sources": "A variety of fruits, vegetables, cereals, legumes, combined with poultry, fish, nuts, seeds, olive oil and moderate red wine intake with meals ",
      "Purported Uses2": [

        "Cancer prevention",
        "Weight management",
        "Diabetes management",
        "Cholesterol management"
      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "The health benefits of the diet are attributed to the synergistic interactions across nutrients, and not to a single nutrient . At the same time, specific activities have been identified to partly explain the cardioprotective and anti-inflammatory effects, including decreases in oxidative stress, inflammation, plasma N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) concentrations, and tumor necrosis factor α  . Greater polyphenol intake from lignans, flavonols, and hydroxybenzoic acids found in the Mediterranean diet may be associated with decreased cardiovascular disease risks . Extra virgin olive oil, which contains phenolic compounds, vitamin E, and other lipid molecules, also has antiatherogenic effects, improving endothelial function, lipid profiles, insulin sensitivity, glycemic control, and blood pressure levels ",

Scientists believe that it controls circadian rhythms of sleep and wakefulness. Nighttime darkness causes increased production of melatonin, promoting sleep and causing a decrease in body temperature. Both elderly and depressed patients tend to have lower baseline levels of melatonin.Laboratory studies suggest that melatonin is a potent antioxidant that stimulates some aspects of the immune system, but it is not known if this effect occurs in humans. Melatonin also inhibits the growth of certain cancer cells including breast cancer and melanoma when it is directly applied to these cells. Studies in humans, however, do not show an anticancer effect. When used at the same time as specific chemotherapy drugs, melatonin may increase survival time.",

      "Clinical Summary": "Melatonin is produced endogenously in humans by the pineal gland. Although the exact mechanism of action is unknown, melatonin is thought to control the circadian pacemaker and promote sleep . Small amounts of melatonin are found in fruits, nuts, olive oil and wine. The supplemental form is used as a sleep-aid.Clinical studies suggest that melatonin may decrease sleep latency and improve sleep duration , but randomized trials have produced mixed data . No significant effects of melatonin on secondary sleep disorders associated with medical, neurological, or substance abuse disorders were found in a meta-analysis . Melatonin may decrease surgery-associated anxiety and pain  as well as the frequency of migraine attacks A systematic review indicates that it can reduce perioperative anxiety, but its analgesic effect remains inconclusiveIn vitro and in vivo studies suggest that melatonin has antioxidant  and antiproliferative properties, including against breast cancer cells , as well as synergistic effects with anticancer agents , and protective effects against adriamycin-induced cardiotoxicity Clinical trials evaluating melatonin as a monotherapy or in combination with other agents and in patients with solid tumors suggest improvements in quality of life and survival time . Other studies yielded conflicting results . Further, in studies of postmenopausal breast cancer survivors, short-term melatonin supplementation did not influence estradiol levels  but improved sleep quality . However, a case report suggests that use of oral melatonin may delay menopause in premenopausal women by modulating levels of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and estrogen ",

      "Mechanism of Action": "Melatonin is an endogenously produced indolamine hormone secreted by the pineal gland in humans. Nocturnal secretion is regulated by circadian rhythms and nighttime darkness , and melatonin is thought to control the circadian pacemaker and promote sleep. Ironically, melatonin is associated with wakefulness and activity in nocturnal animals . As levels of melatonin increase, an associated drop in core body temperature occurs. Both elderly and depressed patients tend to have lower basal levels of melatonin Melatonin appears to be a potent free-radical scavenger  and enhances antioxidative enzyme activities , interacting with cytosolic calmodulin and stimulating the production of IL-4 in bone marrow T-lymphocytes . In vitro and animal studies suggest that antitumor effects may occur through antimitotic or immunomodulatory activity. In vitro studies demonstrate that melatonin has antiproliferative effects on human breast cancer (HS578T)  and mouse melanoma (B16BL6, PG19) . Decreases in breast cancer metastasis may occur via modulation of Rho-associated kinase protein-1 expression . Melatonin reduces proliferation of PC-3 and LNCaP cells in mice, but has no effect on apoptosis . The effect of melatonin on tumor cell growth may be mediated in part by melatonin receptor signaling . In endometrial cancer cells, it interferes with estrogen receptor expression . Other laboratory studies suggest that melatonin behaves both as a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) and an aromatase inhibitor ",

      "How It Works": "Metabolic therapies do not treat or cure cancer.\nCancer is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. However, most people who promote metabolic therapies stress the environmental component, claiming that cancer is caused by an accumulation of toxins in the body from sources such as food additives, preservatives, pesticides, and industrial pollution. The removal of these toxins through bowel purging and a healthy diet, they claim, allows the body to heal naturally. Although diet may play a role in cancer prevention and it is true that some cancers are associated with environmental exposures, there are no data to show that toxins can be removed to change the course of cancer. Some aspects of metabolic diets can be harmful. For example, (1) the Gerson regimen restricts the diet to an unhealthy point and can cause nutritional deficiencies, (2) over-supplementation in such diets has led to toxicity and hospitalization, and (3) animal extracts were found to be contaminated.\nCoffee enemas are used in several metabolic therapies. There are theories about coffee enemas aiding excretion from the liver and colon, but none of them have been proven. In addition, coffee enemas can cause electrolyte imbalances in the blood and impaired nutrient absorption.",

      "Special Point": "Eating a balanced diet rich in fiber, fruits, and vegetables is known to be an important part of preventing disease, but there is no proof that diet or supplements can treat or cure cancer. Although controlling one’s diet may create a greater sense of personal control, especially during cancer treatment, the extreme restrictions advocated by proponents of metabolic therapies can be harmful because they lead to severe nutritional deficiencies. In addition, cancer patients run the risk of abandoning effective conventional therapies when they choose to pursue alternative therapies.",
      "Clinical Summary": "As strict dietary and detoxification regimens promoted to prevent and treat cancer and degenerative diseases, metabolic therapies are based on the theory that cancer and other diseases are caused by an accumulation of toxic substances in the body. Advocates claim that a healthy diet and practices including coffee enemas, herbal laxatives, and immune augmentation detoxify the body and allow it to heal naturally. Therapies such as Gerson, Kelley, Contreras, Manner, and Gonzalez share this ideology but differ in modality. The diets are often based on whole foods including fresh fruits and vegetables, and are supplemented by digestive enzymes, glandular extracts, megadose vitamins, minerals, or herbal products. Agents such as hydrazine sulphate, hydrogen peroxide, or laetrile may also be administered.\nRetrospective reviews of the Gerson, Kelley, and Contreras therapies show no evidence of efficacy. Recent findings from a study involving patients with inoperable pancreatic cancer showed a decrease in overall survival and poorer quality of life with proteolytic enzymes, often used to supplement a metabolic therapy diet, compared with standard gemcitabine-based chemotherapy \nAlthough dietary remedies provide a strong sense of personal control, the strict recommendations of some metabolic therapies can cause nutritional deficiencies, while some entail potentially toxic doses of supplements or agents. Coffee enemas can cause sepsis, dangerous electrolyte deficiencies, and death.The American Cancer Society urges cancer patients not to seek treatment with metabolic therapies.",

The removal of these toxins through bowel purging and a healthy diet, they claim, allows the body to heal naturally. While diet may play a role in cancer prevention and some cancers are associated with environmental exposures, strict dietary restrictions, as in the Gerson regimen, cause nutritional deficiencies.Caffeine in coffee enemas is purported to cause dilation of bile ducts, bile production, glutathione S-transferase (GST) activation, and excretion of toxic breakdown products by the liver and through the colon wall. Kahweol and cafestol are constituents of green coffee that stimulate GST activation, but their activity is destroyed with roasting. Repeated administration of coffee enemas increases extravascular fluid volume and can cause serum electrolyte imbalances. Significant loss of bile salts associated with repeated long-term administration of enemas can result in malabsorption of fat, fat-soluble vitamins, and calcium ",

      "How It Works": "Milk thistle protects against alcohol-induced liver damage, and even reverses its effects in some cases. Whether it can treat other liver diseases is not clear.\nLaboratory studies support milk thistle’s liver protective effects. For example, when rats fed milk thistle are given toxins and drugs that are known to be toxic to the liver, they are protected from liver damage compared to rats not given milk thistle. Scientists think that silymarin, a compound in milk thistle, alters and stabilizes the structure of the liver cells so that toxins cannot enter them as easily. In addition, it stimulates the synthesis of proteins, which is an important part of cell growth and regeneration after damage.Studies also show that milk thistle may protect against Alzheimer’s disease and has anticancer activity against colon and prostate cancer cells. Silymarin was shown to have estrogenic effects in rats. It is not known if these effects occur in the human body.",

In vitro and animal studies suggest that flavonoids in milk thistle have antioxidant, anticancer effects , and may protect against Alzheimer’s disease \nPlacebo-controlled clinical studies show efficacy of silymarin in reducing aminotransferases in alcoholic liver disease  and suggest its usefulness for liver cirrhosis . Milk thistle was also shown to reduce liver toxicity associated with chemotherapy in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia  and cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity . Other studies show milk thistle may help reduce capecitabine-induced Hand-Foot Syndrome  and radiation therapy-induced mucositis . However, silibinin, derived from milk thistle, promoted the growth of liver cancer when used with alcohol in an animal study Data from a randomized controlled study indicate benefits of milk thistle supplementation in improving glycemic profile in type II diabetic patients . A case study indicates the utility of intravenous silibinin in patients coinfected with HIV and HCV (Hepatitis C virus) \nSilymarin demonstrated estrogenic activity with mild proliferative effects in rat uteri .

      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "Silymarin, a mixture of flavonoids derived from the seeds of milk thistle, is believed to be the active component responsible for the herb’s hepatoprotective effects. Studies done in mice show that silymarin confers hepatoprotection, attributed to its down regulation of extracellular matrix proteins such as collagen, against thioacetamide-induced liver damage in mice . It may also be useful against liver carcinogenesis by negatively affecting the activity of mast cells, a source of matrix metalloproteins that are involved in invasion and angiogenesis . Silymarin reduced cisplatin-induced kidney damage in rats without diminishing its anti-tumor activity . It may play a role in preventing Alzheimer’s disease: studies show that it suppressed formation of amyloid beta-protein and neurotoxicity in mice \nSilibinin, one of the flavonoids, demonstrated antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting release of hydrogen peroxide and production of tumor necrosis factor alpha . Another study showed improvement in endothelial dysfunction in mice by silibinin via reduction in circulating and vascular asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) levels. ADMA is an endogenous inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and is believed to play a role in endothelial dysfunction, associated with cardiovascular disease . Silibinin also inhibits the early phase of HepatitisC viral infection by affecting endosomal trafficking of virions Silybin and isosilybin were also shown to act as strong inhibitors of PXR-mediated CYP3A4 induction . Other studies indicate the flavonoids in milk thistle exert anticancer effects by arresting G1 and S phases of the cell cycle . Silibinin suppressed the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-induced expression of CD44 (the transmembrane receptor for hyaluronan, implicated in tumor cell invasion and metastasis) by inhibiting EGFR activity in breast cancer cells . Silybin was also shown to inhibit growth of hepatocellular carcinoma cells via the Notch signaling pathway ",
      "Adverse Reactions": "Case report: A patient experienced intermittent episodes of sweating, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, weakness and collapse that resolved after discontinuation of milk thistle supplementation Case report: A 25-year-old man developed a severe case of epistaxis, which may have been due to his self medicating with aspirin, garlic, and milk thistle. His symptoms improved following treatment   Clinical study: At high doses, silibinin can elevate bilirubin and liver enzymes ",

Although some oral mistletoe products are sold as dietary supplements and homeopathic medicine, most scientific research has only evaluated intravenous or injected formulations that are not approved as prescription drugs in the United States.Basic research shows that mistletoe extracts may stimulate the immune system to fight cancer. Studies in humans show that mistletoe treatment may improve symptoms and reduce side effects of cancer treatments. A few studies indicate it may also have some effects on survival. More studies are needed to see if mistletoe can be used as supportive therapy in cancer care.",
      "Purported Uses": [
        [
          "To treat cancer and cancer symptoms",
          "Laboratory and animal studies show some anticancer activity. Some human studies show that mistletoe extract can reduce symptoms from cancer treatments and that patients live longer. However, more studies are needed to confirm these effects."

      "Side Effects": "Common: Fever, chills, elevated white blood cell count, reaction at injection site, hypersensitivity.Less common, may indicate toxicity: Diarrhea, vomiting, headache, low blood pressure, low heart rate, fainting or passing out, increased blood sugar, itching, rash.Most reactions were mild, but there are instances of severe toxicity and even death with self-administration or by ingesting raw mistletoe.",
      "Special Point": "Although orally administered mistletoe products are available, most clinical trials have evaluated the injectable forms of mistletoe, which are not approved for use in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration.",

      "Clinical Summary": "Mistletoe is a semi-parasitic plant that grows on various host trees. Mistletoe extracts are used for a variety of conditions including cancer, HIV, hepatitis, and degenerative joint disease. Oral preparations are available as dietary supplements and homeopathic remedies. However, most clinical research has evaluated only parenteral formulations thus far, which are not approved for use in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration.In animal models, mistletoe injections attenuated airway inflammation and eosinophil infiltration . An injectable form of mistletoe lectins reduced clinical signs and symptoms of hepatitis C Mistletoe extracts have shown anticancer effects in animal models . Human studies support the use of mistletoe to improve symptoms and quality of life, and reduce chemotherapy and radiotherapy side effects, including in pancreatic , lung , colorectal , and breast  cancers. It may also prolong survival , although no significant survival effects were found for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer , melanoma , or head and neck cancer . Other preliminary studies suggest that intravesical mistletoe extract is safe and well tolerated in patients with nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer , and that mistletoe extract injection may be efficacious as chemical pleurodesis in patients with malignant pleural effusion In two studies with 5-year follow-ups of breast cancer patients, mistletoe did not appear to negatively influence chemotherapy efficacy  and appeared to continue reductions in persistent symptoms . In patients with advanced solid tumors, the addition of mistletoe administration allowed for higher gemcitabine doses to be used without apparent pharmacokinetic interactions Raw mistletoe contains toxic constituents. Possible adverse effects from mistletoe treatment include injection site reactions, chills, and fever . Long-term use may also reduce T-cell function in cancer patients , but the majority of reactions were mild to moderate and dose-related Mistletoe inhibits CYP3A4 in vitro, so it could theoretically interact with drugs metabolized by this enzyme. However, in vitro studies show this effect only happens in very high doses and is unlikely when used in clinically relevant concentrations ",
      "Purported Uses2": [
        "Cancer symptom control",
        "Cancer treatment",
        "Hepatitis",
        "HIV and AIDS",
        "Hypertension",
        "Immunostimulation"
      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "Mistletoe lectins are the most investigated single component of mistletoe extracts, with cytotoxic effects attributed in part to ribosome-inactivating properties and apoptotic induction . In vitro studies show that lectins induce macrophage cytotoxicity, stimulate immune-cell phagocytosis, increase TNFα, IL-1, IL-2, and IL-6 cytokine secretion, and enhance cytotoxicity . In lymphoblastic leukemia cells, mistletoe extracts stimulate dendritic cell maturation and activation  and induce dose-dependent apoptosis through caspase-8 and -9 dependent pathways In animal models, triterpene-containing mistletoe extracts produced the greatest apoptotic induction  and improved efficacy against malignant melanoma compared with conventional extracts via reduced tumor angiogenesis . Viscotoxins may also be responsible for tumor-inhibiting and immune-stimulating activities . However, mistletoe produced both pro- and anti-proliferative effects depending on dose Mistletoe preparations induce T-helper 2 immune response, as evidenced by significant eosinophilia during treatment in patients with chronic hepatitis C . Mistletoe-induced immune stimulation may explain physical improvements that contribute to increased quality of life in cancer patients ",
      "Contraindications": "Pregnant women should not consume mistletoe due to uterine stimulant activity of tyramine and unidentified constituents ",
      "Adverse Reactions": "Common: Injection site reactions, fever , flu-like symptoms , leukocytosis Uncommon: Diarrhea, nausea , vomiting, headache, increased blood glucose, decreased blood pressure, syncope, generalized pruritus, urticaria ; bradycardia , organ toxicity ; fatigue, pain Long-term use: Reduced T-cell function in cancer patients \nMost infusion reactions were mild to moderate and dose-related Case reports Subcutaneous inflammation mimicking metastatic malignancy: In a 61-year-old breast cancer patient 2 months post-surgery, induced by mistletoe injections self-administered over 12 months Fatalities: Rare, and due to excessive ingestion of mistletoe teas Severe hypertension: Possibly related to intratumoral injection in 1 patient Hepatotoxicity: Significantly increased AST and ALT levels in a 55-year-old man with no significant medical history and a 10-day history of mild fever and brownish urine. Liver injury was related to the use of mistletoe and kudzu extracts. Values gradually returned to normal after 8 days of hospitalization ",
      "Herb-Drug Interactions": "Cytochrome P450 3A4 substrates: Mistletoe inhibits CYP3A4 and may affect intracellular concentrations of drugs metabolized by this enzyme. However, the effect is minimal when used in clinically relevant concentrations ",

      "Scientific Name": "Moringa oleifera",
      "Clinical Summary": "Moringa oleifera (MO) is an edible plant that is native to Asia and Africa and also cultivated around the world. Its leaves and seed pods are nutritious and widely consumed as food; the bark and root are thought to have medicinal properties and are employed in folk remedies. Products derived from the herb are used to treat a variety of conditions, including asthma, diabetes, ulcers, infections and cancer. In addition, the plant extracts are used in primitive water filtration systems to remove pollutants and algae \nIn vitro and animal studies indicate that the leaf, seed, and root extracts of MO have anticancer , hepatoprotective , hypoglycemic , anti-inflammatory , antibacterial , antifungal , antiviral , and antisickling  effects. They may also protect against Alzheimer’s disease  and stomach ulcers , help lower cholesterol levels , promote wound healing , and alleviate symptoms of ulcerative colitis . Clinical data are limited , and preliminary findings show that MO exerts positive, although a small, effect on lipid profiles ; an MO leaf powder increases insulin secretion in healthy subjects ; and improves the nutritional intake and nutritional status of AIDS patients undergoing antiretroviral therapy An MO extract demonstrated anti-fertility effects in a murine model. Whether similar effects occur in humans is not known ",

      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "The antioxidant , hypolipidemic and antiatherosclerotic activities of MO are thought to help prevent cardiovascular diseases . It also showed hepatoprotective effects  and protected the liver from acetaminophen toxicity by maintaining glutathione level . MO can reduce blood glucose levels as well,  which suggests hypoglycemic effects. The fiber content of the leaves can mediate quercetin-3-glucoside to improve glucose tolerance . In addition, phenolic glycosides from the fruit show anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting nitric oxide . Dipeptide and urea derivatives from MO roots also have anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive effects and may benefit those with arthritis . The ethanolic seed extract demonstrated immunosuppressive/anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting leukocytes and splenocytes  and via inhibiting histamine release from mast cells . It also reduced airway inflammation suggesting it may benefit those with asthma . Phenolic components may be responsible for its antisickling activities . In an animal model, MO root extract demonstrated protective effects on the liver and kidney in a dose dependent manner . It reduced urinary oxalate and may help prevent urolithiasis . MO extract is also thought to have protective effects against stomach ulcers by modulating 5-HT receptors  and cholesterol-lowering ability by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase A water extract of MO showed hormone modulation properties, stimulated uterine and cervical epithelium metaplasia , and exhibited antifertility effects . A leaf extract of MO exhibits protective effects against Alzheimer’s disease by modulating monoamines in the brain . It also may help promote wound healing by increasing collagen deposits Furthermore, MOexhibits anticancer effects via apoptosis in cancer cells  and also by inhibiting NF-kappaB . In an animal model, an MO extract helped prevent chemical-induced tumor formation by increasing glutathione activity ",

      "How It Works": "Music can promote relaxation and distraction from pain associated with many illnesses.\nMusic therapy emerged as a formal discipline in the United States in the 1940s. Currently, there are over 5,000 trained therapists working throughout the country. Patients listen to or perform music under the guidance of a professionally trained music therapist.Studies have shown that music reduces anxiety, stress and pain after surgery. Music is thought to reduce blood pressure in listeners. It also improves coordination in stroke and Parkinson’s disease patients. Music helps improve social and emotional aspects and quality of life in patients with Alzheimer’s disease and dementia. Music therapy is also effective for improving depressive symptoms.Music has clinically significant benefits for premature infants in intensive care units. It also helps to change behaviors in children with autism and to reduce anxiety and increase comfort in hospitalized children with cancer. Music therapy can reduce mood disturbance in cancer patients undergoing stem cell transplantation, reduce anxiety in patients receiving radiation therapy, and improve quality of life in patients with terminal cancer. Because music therapy is noninvasive and free of side effects, it is being added as part of standard care in major cancer hospitals.",

      "Clinical Summary": "Music as therapy has been used since ancient times. It emerged as a formal discipline in the United States in the late 1940s. Currently, there are over 5,000 music therapists working in clinical settings throughout the country. Patients listen to or perform music under the guidance of a professionally trained music therapist. Music can promote relaxation and provide distraction from pain, and has been used to reduce postoperative pain  and help alleviate anxiety and stress . Conclusions of a systematic review support music therapy in alleviating preoperative anxiety Music may also help improve social and emotional aspects in patients with Alzheimer’s disease  and improve quality of life in patients with dementia  and stroke . A randomized trial showed the positive effects of group music therapy on improving mild to moderate dementia in elderly individuals . However, improvisational music therapy did not reduce symptoms in children with autism spectrum disorder Music was superior to standard care in reducing anxiety among intensive care unit patients receiving acute ventilatory support for respiratory failure . In addition, music therapy, in combination with pulmonary rehabilitation, may have value in managing pulmonary disease . It also was reported to improve respiratory function in patients with mild asthma and decreased dyspnea in men with asthma Music therapy may help alleviate symptoms associated with cancer and its treatments as well. Data from a retrospective analysis suggest a positive association between music therapy and decreased breathing problems in cancer patients receiving hospice care . Music also reduced mood disturbance  and improved coping and social integration  in cancer patients undergoing autologous stem cell transplantation, a procedure known to cause significant psychological distress. In patients with newly diagnosed head and neck or breast cancer, music therapy significantly relieved anxiety and distress during simulated radiation therapy . Other data also indicate that music alleviates pain  and anxiety in breast cancer patients , in those receiving chemotherapy  and radiation therapy , and improves the quality of life in people with terminal cancer . Music also reduces pain and anxiety, and increases comfort in hospitalized children with cancer . Women undergoing colposcopy reported reduced anxiety and pain perception after listening to slow-rhythm music . Conclusions from systematic reviews, however, question the clinical significance of music therapy for treating pain , and also point to the poor methodology in several music therapy trials \nBecause music therapy is noninvasive and free of side effects, it is integrated into standard care in major cancer hospitals to help relieve pain and physical and psychological discomfort.",

It has also been used medicinally, and recent laboratory studies in animals have shown certain biological activities. Myrrh extracts may protect against damage to the stomach mucus lining by substances such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and alcohol. It may also have antioxidant properties and stimulate the thyroid gland. In animal studies, myrrh reduces inflammation and fevers. There also appears to be anticancer activity based on experiments that show slowing of cancer growth in mice, and decreased proliferaton or death in isolated cancer cells. It is unknown, however, if these effects can occur in humans.A small study showed that myrhh may be effective in treating trichomoniasis vaginalis, a sexually transmitted disease.",

Aqueous extracts of myrrh may induce hepatic microsomal enzymes, causing a more rapid metabolism of warfarin C.molmol inhibits the growth of Ehrlich carcinoma cells in mice . The cytotoxic activities appear to be as effective as cyclophosphamide in solid tumor-bearing mice. Results of one study reveal that the Na, K and Ca levels in cancer cells were reduced by treatment of C. molmol, leading to inhibition of cellular proliferation and tumor growth . Another in vitro study found that myrrh gum had tumoricidal effect against a malignant murine neuroblastoma cell line .  The antiproliferative activity of sesquiterpenoids ST1 and ST2 from myrhh in human prostate cancer cells may occur through androgen receptor signaling inhibition ",

      "How It Works": "N-acetylcysteine is an effective drug for acetaminophen overdose and to break up mucus. It has not been proven to be an effective treatment for cancer.N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is a compound that is found naturally in the body. It is converted to a chemical called glutathione, which plays a role in the detoxification of foreign substances in the body. It is used as an antidote for acetaminophen overdose. NAC itself is an antioxidant that is thought to neutralize free radicals that cause damage to DNA. Animals fed with NAC have less cellular damage and fewer lung, colon, and bladder tumors, compared with those fed a normal diet. In addition, NAC interferes with tumor invasion, metastasis, and blood vessel growth in lab experiments. However, few of these effects have been shown to occur in humans. An animal study shows NAC can speed up the growth of lung cancer cells due to its antioxidant activity.NAC can dissolve and loosen mucus in patients with respiratory disorders such as chronic bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but study results are mixed. Animal studies also show that it might protect against tissue damage from drugs such as doxorubicin, ifosfamide, and cyclophosphamide. These effects are currently being studied in humans.NAC regulates glutamate levels in the brain. It has been studied for several psychiatric disorders in humans with limited success.",

      "Scientific Name": "N-Acetylcysteine",
      "Clinical Summary": "N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is an antioxidant that is used as a prescription drug and as a dietary supplement. As a drug, it is given parenterally or orally to treat acetaminophen overdose. The inhalant and oral solution forms have a mucolytic effect to relieve obstructions in bronchial diseases and in tracheotomy procedures. The oral capsule is marketed as a dietary supplement for its liver protective function and is popular among patients with AIDS and cancer.Clinical studies show NAC can treat drug-induced hepatotoxicity , prevent and treat conditions of oxidative stress and reduce GSH levels caused by diseases such as HIV/AIDS  and cancer , and alleviate toxicity from chemo- and radiotherapy Results for treatment of chronic lung disease with NAC are mixed. NAC reduces the number of acute exacerbations in patients with chronic bronchopulmonary disease  and significantly improves lung function and endurance in COPD patients after exercise , but benefits were not observed in other trials , including a study of high-dose NAC . In cystic fibrosis patients, long-term oral NAC maintained lung function but had no effect on biomarkers of neutrophilic inflammation . NAC was not helpful for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and did not alter the tolerability profile of pirfenidone ; nor was it helpful for Lou Gehrig’s disease Oral NAC reduced oxidative stress and preserved renal function in hemodialysis patients NAC has glutamate modulating effects  and has been tested as a treatment for psychiatric disorders  including addictions  and substance abuse . It also reduced symptoms of trichotillomania Studies in smokers  and patients with a history of adenomatous colonic polyps  show NAC inhibits cancer biomarker development, although it did not inhibit the formation of secondary head and neck or lung tumors . In addition, NAC accelerated lung cancer growth in an animal model Preliminary studies suggest oral NAC may help reduce chemotherapy-induced neuropathy , but a single oral dose of NAC did not protect moles from UV-induced oxidative stress . In leukemia patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic SCT preceded by high-dose chemotherapy, parenteral NAC reduced incidence and duration oral mucositis Gastrointestinal side effects from the consumption of NAC have been reported . Due to its antioxidant activity, it may interfere with the actions of some chemotherapy drugs.",

      "Mechanism of Action": "NAC is a precursor to glutathione (GSH). It is used as both an antidote for acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity and as a mucolytic agent for respiratory diseases. NAC reduces disulphide bonds to sulfhydryl bonds to reduce mucus formation . Its hepatoprotective action may occur by cytokine-mediated mechanisms as well as GSH replenishment . In animal studies, NAC exhibits chemopreventive effects against lung , hepatocellular , esophageal , and immune system  cancers.An in vitro study shows NAC may improve the benefit of ifosfamide by decreasing the risk of nephrotoxicity without interfering with the agent’s antitumor effect . Another study finds that NAC alters doxorubicin-induced NF-κB activity via concentration-dependent anti- and pro-oxidant mechanisms . This biphasic effect is also time-dependent . In androgen-independent human prostate cancer PC-3 cells, NAC has an antiproliferative effect by upregulating Cyr61 protein expression NAC amide can increase bioavailability and reduce oxidative stress, but it does not decrease doxorubicin-induced cell death in H9c2 cardiomyocytes . In an animal study, NAC increased lung cancer cell proliferation due to its antioxidant activity by reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS), DNA damage and p53 expression NAC crosses the blood-brain barrier and increases the brain GSH levels. NAC acts as a glutamine modulator  and plays a role in treating psychiatry disorders ",
      "Adverse Reactions": "Common (Oral): Gastrointestinal disturbance, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, conjunctival irritation, skin rash Other: Hypotension, anaphylaxis, asthma attacks, headache Case reports Photosensitivity not attributable to location, season, or concomitant medication: Occurred among pulmonary fibrosis patients more frequently with acetylcysteine than placebo in combination with pirfenidone ",

        "May increase the risk of bleeding"
      ],
      "Clinical Summary": "Nattokinase is an extracelluar enzyme secreted by the bacterium Bacillus subtilis, used to ferment boiled or steamed soybeans resulting in a preparation called nattō. Nattō has been consumed as food in Japan for several centuries. Nattokinase is also available as a supplement and is most known for its fibrinolytic and thrombolytic effects.A few studies have explored its antihypertensive and amyloid-plaque degrading abilities . Nattokinase decreases platelet aggregation and thrombus formation in a dose-dependent fashion both in vitro and in vivo . Reduced intimal thickening was observed in the femoral artery of rats that were fed a diet containing nattō In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled human trial, nattokinase capsules reduced diastolic and systolic blood pressure in pre-hypertensive patients . The observation that nattokinase degrades amyloid plaques  led to an interest in exploring it as a treatment for Alzheimer’s disease, which is characterized by accumulation of amyloid plaques.Nattokinase has also been promoted as an alternative anticancer treatment based on the notion that it can help dissolve the fibrin coating around a tumor, and increase oxygen supply in the blood to inhibit cancer cell growth. However, these mechanisms have not been proven in humans.Theoretically, nattokinase may increase bleeding risk when used with anticoagulant, antiplatelet, and fibrinolytic drugs. Raw nattō contains high levels of vitamin K that may interfere with the action of warfarin ",

      "Purported Uses2": [
        "Antithrombotic",
        "Fibrinolytic",
        "Alzheimer’s disease",
        "Hypertension",
        "Cancer treatment"
      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "In vitro studies show that nattokinase decreases clot formation by cleaving and inactivating the plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI) via proteolysis at P1-P1’ peptide bond. PAI is a key inhibitor of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) that converts plasminogen to plasmin. PAI inactivation allows for greater tPA activity and increased lysis of clots . In the absence of PAI, nattokinase affects direct proteolysis of fibrin; however, this effect is less than the protelysis achieved by the PAI-mediated pathway . The fibrinolytic activity of nattokinase is estimated to be four fold that of plasmin Nattokinase is currently being evaluated for its potential as an amyloid plaque-degrading agent. Low doses of nattokinase have been shown to increase expression of the ADAM10 gene, which belongs to a family of proteinases that degrade the amyloid precursor protein (APP). The upregulation of ADAM10 may shift the amyloidogenic pathway to the non-amyloidogenic pathway. This activity may be used as a method to prevent amyloid plaque accumulation that characterizes Alzheimer’s disease ",
      "Warnings": "Theoretically, nattokinase can cause an existing clot to dislodge due to its fibrinolytic property, resulting in a stroke or embolus at a distal location. Patients with a history of deep vein thrombosis should avoid of use nattokinase ",
      "Contraindications": "Patients with coagulation disorders and those currently undergoing anticoagulant, fibrinolytic, or antithrombotic treatments should avoid nattokinase.",

      "How It Works": "In high-risk individuals, nicotinamide supplementation had protective effects against certain types of skin lesions and nonmelanoma skin cancersNicotinamide is a water-soluble form of vitamin B3 or niacin. It is made in the body by eating niacin-rich foods such as fish, poultry, nuts, legumes, eggs, and cereal grains. Nicotinamide supplements are used to treat skin conditions and niacin deficiencies.Recent studies suggest nicotinamide may protect against some forms of skin lesions in patients with sun-damaged skin. Additional studies are needed to confirm safety and effectiveness across different types of skin cancer and in different people. In addition, the protective effects of nicotinamide against UV exposure does not mean that it protects against sunburn. ",
      "Purported Uses": "To prevent skin cancer\nA large study found that taking nicotinamide can reduce the risk of getting certain types of skin cancers. Additional long-term studies are needed.To treat acne and other skin conditions\nNicotinamide is used as a medicine for treating skin conditions such as acne and rosacea.",

          "You are taking anticonvulsants such ascarbamazepine",
          ": Nicotinamide may i",
          "ncrease the blood levels and risk of side effects of this drug."
        ]
      ],
      "Side Effects": "Nicotinamide appears to be largely well tolerated, but high oral doses may cause nausea, vomiting, headache, fatigue, dizziness, or liver toxicity.",
      "Special Point": [
        "Although nicotinamide appears to protect against ultraviolet (UV) light exposure, it is not a substitute for sunscreen and does not protect against sunburn.",
        "Even though niacin can become nicotinamide in the body, their effects and side effects when used as supplements are different and not interchangeable."
      ],
      "Scientific Name": "Pyridine-3-carboxamide",
      "Clinical Summary": "Nicotinamide, also known as niacinamide, is a water-soluble amide form of niacin or vitamin B3. It is found in foods such as fish, poultry, eggs, and cereal grains. It is also marketed as a dietary supplement, and as a non-flushing form of niacin.Nicotinamide has established medical uses to treat conditions stemming from niacin deficiency such as pellagra. Oral and topical formulations are used to treat a variety of inflammatory skin conditions including acne vulgaris and rosacea An animal study suggests nicotinamide supplementation can help prevent glaucoma by preserving mitochondrial function . Other preclinical models demonstrate photoimmunoprotective and chemopreventive effects against UV radiation . Nicotinamide enhances repair of UV radiation-induced DNA damage in human melanocytes  and keratinocytes  and similar effects have been demostrated in human studies . Other clinical trials show oral nicotinamide reduces UV-induced  and photodynamic therapy (PDT)-induced  immunosuppression.In patients with sun-damaged skin, oral nicotinamide helped prevent the occurrence of nonaggressive skin cancers . In a small trial among renal transplant patients however, such similar effects were not significant . Other studies found reduction in actinic keratoses, a predictor of melanoma risk . Additional studies are warrented Nicotinamide appears to be largely well tolerated in clinical studies . Even though niacin is converted into nicotinamide in the body , these two supplements should not be viewed as interchangeable as they have different side effect profiles ",
      "Food Sources": "Fish, poultry, eggs, nuts, legumes, beef, cereal grains, fortified foods; smaller amounts are also found in green vegetables.",
      "Purported Uses2": [
        "Acne and other dermatological conditions",

      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "Nicotinamide is chemically part of the coenzymes nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide NAD+ and NADH . They are used in oxidation-reduction reactions in the body. Among these activities is the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) , which fuels cellular metabolic activities.Photoimmunoprotective effects of oral or topical nicotinamide are linked to its support for DNA repair by preventing post-UV exposure declines in cellular energy or the repletion of energy to irradiated cells . Its influence on several pathways contribute to this enhanced repair of UV-induced DNA damage . In UV-irradiated keratinocytes, nicotinamide reduced expression of IL-6, IL-10, MCP-1 and TNF-alpha mRNA, cytokine mediators whose activity may be involved in inflammation, cellular-tissue injury, cell death, and skin cancer . In human melanocytes, nicotinamide increased the global nucleotide excision repair rate and number of irradiated melanocytes undergoing DNA repair Effects of topical nicotinamide on inflammatory skin conditions are attributed to its sebosuppressive and anti-inflammatory properties Although niacin and nicotinamide are considered similar in their role as vitamins, their pharmacologic indications, effects, and side effects are different. Niacin has high affinity to a G-protein-coupled receptor HM74A in human cells resulting in the releasing of prostaglandins that cause vasodilation or flushing of the skin. It also lowers cholesterol  . However, nicotinamide does not have these effects.",
      "Adverse Reactions": "Nicotinamide appears to be largely well tolerated . However nausea, vomiting, and other gastrointestinal symptoms, as well as headache, fatigue, dizziness  and liver toxicity  have been associated with high oral doses.",

      "Scientific Name": "Nigella sativa",
      "Clinical Summary": "Nigella sativa is a flowering plant found throughout India, Arabia, and Europe. The seeds, commonly known as black seeds or black cumin, are used in cooking and in traditional medicine for inflammation, infection, and cancer.Constituents from N. sativa  demonstrated immunomodulatory , antioxidant , antiparasitic  and hepatoprotective effects  in vitro and in animal studies. N. sativa seed may be useful in the treatment of asthma , hypertension , rheumatoid arthritis , dyspepsia , and diabetes  in humans. Thymoquinone, a major constituent of N. sativa, exhibited antiepileptic effects in children with refractory seizures N. sativa  may also relieve symptoms of allergic reactions , but allergic contact dermatitis was reported with topical use Evidence also suggests that N. sativa  has anticancer properties. Thymoquinone and other constituents of the seeds reduced the growth and size of tumors in rats . Thymoquinone also enhanced the anticancer effects of doxorubicin in certain cancer cell lines N. sativa oil, when injected, demonstrated a protective effect against tissue damage caused by radiation in rats  . Human studies are lacking.\nAdverse effects are rare, but high doses of N. sativa oil caused liver and kidney damage in rats ",

      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "Thymoquinone, one of the chief constituents of Nigella sativa oil has antioxidant effects and restored the levels of lactate dehydrogenase, glutathione, and SOD in animal models . This may also explain N. sativa’s hepatoprotective effects . Studies have also shown that N. sativa oil has anti-inflammatory properties by inhibiting cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase . An in vitro study demonstrated that nigellone, a constituent of the crude extract of N. sativa seeds, inhibited histamine release from rat peritoneal mast cells  and may reduce allergy symptoms in humans N. sativa decreased hypertension in rats possibly due to its diuretic effects . It was also shown to decrease uterine smooth muscle contractions \nThe antioxidant effect is thought to protect tissues from radiation injury . However, it is not clear if this would also make radiation therapy less effective. Thymoquinone administered to mice reduced the incidence of stomach tumors . Possible mechanisms include inhibition of DNA synthesis , and promotion of apoptosis by inhibiting cell growth in G1 phase The methanol extract of N. sativa exhibits in vitro estrogenic activity after naringinase treatment ",

      "How It Works": "Noni showed anticancer effects in laboratory studies, but results from human studies are lacking.The juice of the noni fruit has been traditionally used in Polynesian cultures as an anticancer agent. Scientists have isolated a fraction from noni juice that is rich in complex sugars. This fraction, alone and in conjunction with chemotherapy drugs, is able to increase the survival of laboratory mice that have been implanted with lung cancer. Scientists are unsure exactly how noni exerts this effect, but observe that it enhances certain aspects of the immune system. Furthermore, noni juice acts as an antioxidant and slows the transformation of normal cells to cancer cells in animal studies.",
      "Purported Uses": [
        [
          "To treat cancer",
          "Laboratory studies in human cell lines and animals show that noni extracts have anticancer effects both when used alone and with chemotherapy drugs. However, there is no proof from clinical trials that the same effect occurs in humans, although a preliminary study is underway."

        [
          "To treat diabetes",
          "Although some compounds in noni have antidiabetic properties in the lab, there is no clinical evidence to support this use. In addition, noni fruit is rich in complex sugars and therefore may worsen medical conditions associated with high blood sugar levels."

      "Scientific Name": "Morinda citrifolia",
      "Clinical Summary": "Noni is an evergreen plant found throughout Polynesia. It bears fleshy yellow-white fruit and is used in traditional medicine for wound healing, infections, diarrhea, skin conditions, and as a tonic. It is also cultivated in Hawaii and other Polynesian islands and is marketed worldwide. Fresh or fermented juices are available as drinks while capsules, pills, and powders are sold as dietary supplements.In vitro and animal studies suggest that noni extracts and its constituents have antibacterial , antifungal , anti-inflammatory , antidiabetic , hepatoprotective , prokinetic , antitumor , and immunomodulatory  properties. Noni also inhibits low-density-lipoprotein oxidation and may be useful in preventing arteriosclerosis . It improved memory in animal models of impairment  and activated cell-mediated immunity . Glycosides, iridoids, and other constituents isolated from the fruits and leaves have demonstrated antioxidant effects . In addition, a >5% concentration of noni juice was shown to have antiangiogenic properties in an ex vivo assay  , and cervical cancer cell lines treated with 10% noni altered oxidative stress markers and DNA repair gene expression In human studies, a noni extract was shown to be effective in reducing incidence of early postoperative nausea . Consumption of noni juice alleviated cigarette smoke-induced dyslipidemia  Morinda citrifolia should not be confused with Morinda officinalis, also known as Ba Ji Tian, commonly used in Chinese medicine.",
      "Purported Uses2": [

        "Health maintenance",
        "Hypertension",
        "Immunostimulation",
        "Pain"
      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "Glycosides isolated from noni juice inhibit AP-1 transactivation and cell transformation in mouse epidermal JB6 cell lines . Antidiabetic characteristics of some noni compounds are attributed to inhibition of the protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B enzyme . Anti-inflammatory activity in noni extract was attributed to quercetin . In addition, noni juice exhibited antioxidant effects by reducing aromatic DNA adducts In animal models, an aqueous extract of noni root produced a central analgesic effect that was antagonized by naloxone . Hepatoprotective effects occur through regulation of lipid homeostasis, antioxidant status, and anti-inflammatory responses . The primary iridoid deacetylasperulosidic acid may exert antioxidant effects by increasing superoxide dismutase activity . Scopoletin and rutin in noni may be responsible for antidopaminergic and antiadrenergic effects . Scopoletin also stimulates gastrointestinal motility by acting as a 5-HT4 receptor agonist . Treatment with noni extract prevented memory impairment through increased brain energy metabolism, cholinergic neurotransmission, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and antioxidative activity When combined with suboptimal doses of certain chemotherapy agents, polysaccharides from noni improved survival time and curative effects . Apoptotic effects occur via upregulation of p53 and proapoptotic Bax proteins, as well as downregulation of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2, Bcl-XL proteins and survivin. Increase in caspase 9 and 3 was also reported, which suggests involvement of the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway . In cervical cancer cell lines, malondialdehyde levels were significantly reduced when treated with noni, alone or in combination with cisplatin alone . The antitumor effects of damnacanthal from noni are attributed to its inhibitory effects on the HGF/c-Met axis in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells, with decreases in Akt phosphorylation and matrix metalloproteinase-2 secretion . Noni extract induced apoptosis, G1/S phase cell-cycle arrest, and decreased intracellular ROS generation and mitochondrial membrane potential in breast cancer cells ",

      "Mechanism of Action": "Studies conducted in vitro and in animals have shown that O. diffusa exerts antitumor effects via apoptosis , dose-dependent increase of oxidative burst , caspase-dependent apoptosis , and apoptosis in a cell-cycle independent fashion possibly through the induction of genotoxic damage . Its immunomodulating effects are via stimulation of the immune system to kill or engulf tumor cells The anti-inflammatory activity of Oldenlandia is due to inhibition of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-6, and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in mouse peritoneal macrophages ",

      "Clinical Summary": "Nerium oleander is an ornamental shrub native to northern Africa, the eastern Mediterranean basin, and Southeast Asia. It is used in traditional medicine to treat hemorrhoids, ulcers, leprosy, and as an abortifacient. The leaf is poisonous because of oleandrin, a cardiac glycoside with structure and actions similar to those of digoxin, and both exert their effects by inhibiting membrane enzyme Na+, K+ -ATPase Most studies have focused on the anticancer activities of oleandrin because of its apoptotic effects in various cancer cell lines . It also increases sensitivity of PC-3 human prostate cells to radiotherapy  and reduces gentamycin toxicity . In other studies oleandrin demonstrated neuroprotective activity  and reduced infectivity of HIV virus \nA hot water extract of the plant, known as Anvirzel™, has been developed as a treatment for cancer, AIDS, and congestive heart failure. It consists of a mixture of oleandrin and the glycone oleandrigenin. Results from an earlier study showed that it is safe in humans when injected intramuscularly although adverse effects such as injection site pain, fatigue, and other GI symptoms were reported Anvirzel™ is not an approved cancer treatment in the United States. Until more data regarding its efficacy and toxicity are available, this product should not be used outside of clinical trials.",

      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "Oleandrin may slow tumor growth by inhibiting the membrane enzyme Na+, K+ -ATPase , especially in cells that have higher ratio of alpha 3 to alpha 1 isoform expression . It improves cellular export of fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) . Oleandrin also induces apoptosis through Fas gene expression in tumor cells  and by suppressing NF-kB . It was shown to selectively sensitize lung cancer cells to apoptosis-inducing ligand Apo2L/TRAIL. This was accompanied by up-regulation of death receptors 4 (DR4) and 5 (DR5) at both the RNA and protein levels \nOther proposed mechanisms include the formation of superoxide radicals that cause tumor cell injury via mitochondrial disruption , inhibition of interleukin-8 that mediates tumorigenesis , activation of caspase-3 , induction of tumor cell autophagy , and inhibition of P-gp In a recent study, PBI-05204, an extract of Nerium Oleander, inhibited the proliferation of the Panc-1 tumor cells in part, via down-regulation of PI3k/Akt and mTOR pathways ",

Further, the leaf extracts demonstrated antimicrobial properties , anti-HIV , and anticancer  properties. Animal studies showed antiarrhythmic, spasmolytic, diuretic , antihypertensive , analgesic , and cholesterol-lowering  effects.\nSmall studies have shown effectiveness of olive leaf extract in reducing blood pressure in patients with hypertension .

      "Mechanism of Action": "The cholesterol-lowering effects of olive leaf extracts (OLE) are thought to be due to oleuropein, a compound present in the leaves. Studies on hypercholesterolemic rats have shown that OLE is more effective at lowering cholesterol than pure oleuropein. This implies that a synergistic effect occurs between oleuropein and another substance within the leaf Oleuropein is converted into elenoic acid in the body which may prevent viruses and bacteria from replicating . The antihypertensive and vasodilating effects of olive leaf occurred independently of the integrity of the vascular endothelium . Constituents of olive leaf have been shown to strongly inhibit the complement system, although it is unknown what effect this has on the body Hypoglycemic activities of olive leaf are attributed to two mechanisms: potentiation of glucose-induced insulin release and increased peripheral uptake of glucose. Hypoglycemic activity is greater in samples collected in the winter months . OLE may prevent diabetic neuropathy by reducing glucose-induced apoptosis through the inhibition of neural caspase 3 activation In vitro studies show that OLE has antimicrobial activities against E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, S. aureus, K. pneumoniae, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Microsporum canis, T. rubrum and Candida albicans. Anti-HIV properties of OLE include up-regulation of the expression of apoptosis inhibitor proteins as well as protein kinase signaling molecules .

      "How It Works": "Omega-3 fatty acids have not been shown to prevent cancer.\nOmega-3 fatty acids are obtained from fish oil. They have been used to protect against cardiovascular events such as heart attack. Studies have shown that omega-3 fatty acids can be taken up by the fatty deposits that line the arteries, thereby improving the stability of those deposits. Omega-3 fatty acids do not seem to affect the clotting of blood. Omega-3 fatty acids may reduce inflammation by decreasing some of the signals that cells send to each other. It is thought that patients with colitis, asthma, cystic fibrosis and those before surgery may benefit from this reduced inflammatory effect. Omega-3 fatty acid supplements have been shown to be absorbed by the skin and protect it against ultra-violet radiation damage.Omega-3 fatty acids may reduce the risk of breast cancer, but may increase the risk of prostate cancer.",

      "Clinical Summary": "A type of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) derived mainly from fish oil, omega-3 fatty acids are used as a dietary supplement for depression, to lower cholesterol, and to reduce the risk of heart attack. A large survey of Finnish adults found that depressive symptoms were significantly higher among infrequent fish consumers  and other studies have shown that individuals with major depression have marked depletions in omega-3 fatty acids . However, omega-3 fatty acid supplementation did not relieve depression in adults with major depression , mild to moderate depression , or perinatal depression , and yielded mixed results in those with schizophrenia . But data from a randomized trial suggest that omega-3 may be useful in reducing the risk of progression to psychiatric disorders and as a safe preventive measure in young adults at risk for psychotic conditions \nSupplementation with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) improved learning and memory function in age-related cognitive decline . However in a large long-term study of omega-3 supplementation with or without multidomain lifestyle interventions of physical activity, cognitive training, and nutritional advice, there were no significant effects on cognitive decline in elderly adults with memory complaints . Consumption of fish oil during pregnancy also did not improve cognitive or language outcomes in early childhood   and does not improve intelligence . Other studies of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation and cognition in young children  and elderly subjects  are inconclusive.\nOmega-3 fatty acid supplementation lowers cholesterol  and may reduce recurrence in patients with a history of stroke . In individuals with cardiovascular risk factors, omega-3 supplementation improved cardiometabolic profiles . However, it does not lower the risk of cardiovascular disease events . Omega-3 may help patients with ulcerative colitis , but was ineffective in the treatment of Crohn’s disease . In adults with rheumatoid arthritis, reductions in NSAID use were reported after omega-3 fatty acid supplementation ; Omega-3 may also be effective in reducing NSAID-associated gastroduodenal damage . Other studies indicate that omega-3 may lower the magnitude of the body’s inflammatory response , and can reduce sensitivity to sunburn  and to ultraviolet radiation . Reviews of trials using omega-3 fatty acids have shown possible benefits for patients with cystic fibrosis , but no benefit in those with asthma . Dietary supplementation with fish oil may help reduce the symptoms of systemic lupus erythematosus \nIn type 1 diabetes, long-term omega-3 supplementation had positive effects on neuropathy, as measured by increases in corneal nerve fiber length . Findings of a systematic review support benefits of polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acid consumption on insulin sensitivity and adipocyte function . However in a recent study among insulin-resistant adults, high-dose omega-3 supplementation did not improve features associated with metabolic syndrome such as adipose tissue lipolysis or inflammation . In another study, DHA was found more effective compared to eicosapentanoic acid (EPA) in modulating indicators of inflammation and blood lipids . In women with gestational diabetes, omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin E co-supplementation improved some markers of inflammation and oxidative stress as well as incidence of newborn hyperbilirubinemia \nIn hemodialysis patients, omega-3 supplementation significantly reduced serum creatinine , but did not reduce arteriovenous fistula failure \nData on omega-3 fatty acid supplementation for cancer prevention are inconclusive. It may reduce colon cancer risk  and improve immune response in patients undergoing colorectal cancer resection , but did not affect cancer outcomes , although data from a prospective study suggest its association with reduced occurrence of renal cell carcinoma in women . Fish oil supplementation may lower the risk of breast cancer . However, high blood concentrations of omega-3 are associated with increased risk of prostate cancer Preliminary findings suggest fish oil supplementation increases chemotherapy efficacy, improves survival , and helps to maintain weight and muscle mass  in patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However in patients with gastric cancer, perioperative immunonutrition via an EPA-supplemented diet did not reduce bodyweight loss after total gastrectomy compared with a standard diet . An EPA-enriched oral supplement improved tolerability of chemotherapy in patients with advanced colorectal cancer And when combined with chemotherapy, fish oil supplementation may delay tumor progression in patients with colorectal cancer  But in a recent study, a type of omega-3 fatty acid, 16:4(n-3), can reduce the activity of cisplatin \nOmega-3 fatty acids are thought to have anticoagulant effects. However, results from clinical studies are mixed ",

      "Mechanism of Action": "Omega-3 fatty acids are polyunsaturated fatty acids containing two or more double bonds in their acyl chain and a double bond on carbon number . Changes in omega-3 fatty acid blood levels have been associated with cardiovascular disease and depression . The cardioprotective effects of omega-3 fatty acids likely are due its ability to be incorporated into and thereby enhance the stability of atherosclerotic plaques . Increasing the intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids has been shown to increase lipid peroxidation. Supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids, therefore, may increase oxidative stress on the body. Studies have shown that mucosal alpha-tocopherol levels decrease upon omega-3 fatty acid supplementation, which researchers believe may result from the body’s attempt to counteract the added oxidative burden . Besides reducing serum antioxidant levels, little is known about how this added oxidative stress affects the body.\nOmega-3 fatty acid supplementation has been shown to decrease IL-6  and tumor necrosis factor-alpha  levels while leaving most other mononuclear cell functions unaffected . Omega-3 fatty acids may also reduce inflammation in patients with ulcerative colitis by reducing rectal dialysate leukotriene B4 . Because of their anti-inflammatory effects, omega-3 fatty acids were thought to benefit patients with asthma  and cystic fibrosis , but data are inconclusive.Increasing PUFA intake in pregnant women increases PUFA concentration but not cytokine concentration in human milk . Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation provides protection against ultra-violet radiation-induced erythema and p53 expression, a biomarker of DNA damage ",

      "Scientific Name": "Pleurotus ostreatus",
      "Clinical Summary": "Oyster mushroom is an edible fungus found widely in North America and Europe. It is used in traditional medicine to treat infections, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and cancer.In vitro experiments and studies done in mice have shown that oyster mushroom has antitumor , immunomodulatory , antifungal , lipid-lowering, and hypoglycemic  properties. Beneficial effects are due to constituents such as polysaccharides, lectins, and peptides.In a study of HIV patients with antiretroviral treatment-induced hypercholesterolemia, oyster mushroom was not effective in lowering non-HDL cholesterol . However pleuran, a beta-glucan isolated from oyster mushroom, demonstrated anti-allergic effects in children with respiratory tract infections . In type 2 diabetic patients, an oyster mushroom preparation reduced postprandial serum glucose levels and increased serum insulin levels ",
      "Food Sources": "Oyster mushroom is an edible fungus, available both in fresh and dried forms. The whole mushroom is often used in soups and sauces.",

        "Diabetes",
        "Hyperlipidemia",
        "Infections"
      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "Pleurostrin, a peptide derived from the fruiting bodies of oyster mushroom, exhibited antifungal properties . Mevinolin, another compound, decreased cholesterol biosynthesis by inhibiting HMG CoA reductase, which is the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis . Ostreolysin, a cytolytic protein isolated from oyster mushroom, caused bradycardia, myocardial ischemia and ventricular extrasystoles following intravenous injection in mice . Suggested hypoglycemic mechanisms include increased glucokinase activity and insulin secretion, which increases glucose utilization by peripheral tissues, inhibits glycogen synthase kinase, and promotes glycogen synthesis \nA lectin isolated from the fruiting bodies of oyster mushroom demonstrated antitumor activity in mice bearing sarcoma and hepatoma . Another study found that the development of precancerous aberrant crypt foci (ACF) was significantly reduced in mice that were fed a diet containing 10% pleuran, a beta-glucan isolated from oyster mushroom . RNase Po1, a guanylic acid-specific ribonuclease (a RNase T1 family RNase) from oyster mushroom has been shown to induce apoptosis in tumor cells ",

      "Mechanism of Action": "The indole alkaloids, the bioactive compounds of P. pereira, showed antiplasmodial activity against a chloroquine-sensitive strain of Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malaria. Of five alkaloids tested, geissolosimine demonstrated the highest activity , although the mechanism of action is yet to be determined. In a mice model, the crude extract and the dichloromethane fraction of P. pereira exerted antinociceptive effects against acetic acid and formalin-induced-nociception, via stimulation of the 5-HT 1A receptor, which is involved in neuromodulation by binding serotonin . In another study, geissospermine, the most abundant alkaloid, inhibited acetylcholinesterase, resulting in increased levels of acetylcholine, and reduced amnesia induced by scopolamine in mice, in a dose dependent manner The anticancer effects of P. pereira are exerted by various mechanisms. One study showed that it induces apoptosis in pancreatic cells both in vitro and in vivo as evidenced by cleavage of caspases 3 and 8 and PARP, associated with DNA damage and inhibition of cell cycle . In experiments with the prostate cancer cell line LNCaP, P. pereira extract reduced tumor cell growth and induced apoptosis, thought to be via beta-carboline alkaloids that upregulate DNA repair response genes and genes involved in apoptosis pathway . Findings of another study suggest that P. pereira extract induces cell growth arrest and apoptosis in LNCaP cells partially via inhibition of the nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) activation, responsible for cell survival ",

      "How It Works": "Passionflower may reduce anxiety, but its long-term safety and effectiveness are not known.Passiflora incarnata is a perennial wildflower that is commonly found in the southern United States. Passionflower extract is contained in many dietary supplement products marketed as sleep aids or anxiety relievers. A handful of studies in humans support these claims, although it is still unknown whether passionflower extracts are safe and effective in the long-term. Scientists are not sure how this herb works, but have speculated that compounds in passionflower may interact with receptors in the brain that would mediate a relaxation response. Studies done in mice suggest that passionflower extracts have mild anti-inflammatory and anti-seizure activity.Because animal studies show disrupted sexual behavior in male offspring, passionflower should be avoided during pregnancy. It may also interact with certain medications as well as have added effects with St. John’s wort and/or valerian",

          "To relieve anxiety",
          "One small clinical trial suggested that passionflower may be as effective as oxazepam, a common drug used for treating general anxiety.

      "Scientific Name": "Passiflora incarnata",
      "Clinical Summary": "Passiflora incarnata is a perennial wildflower that is commonly found in the southern United States. Passionflower extract is used in supplemental form by patients to treat insomnia, anxiety, epilepsy, neuralgia, and withdrawal syndromes from opiates or benzodiazepines. It may also be found in over-the-counter preparations to reduce symptoms associated with menopause and hyperactivity.Animal models suggest antidiabetic , antiasthmatic , and seizure suppression effects . In one study, passionflower reduced seizure severity and immobility periods, and retained brain levels of serotonin and noradrenaline . Another study found that P. incarnata extracts produced anxiogenic effects in mice, although two of these extracts also showed an anticonvulsant effect against seizures In humans, a small pilot study of passionflower for generalized anxiety showed comparable efficacy to oxazepam , but a systematic review concluded that randomized controlled studies are needed to confirm such effects . In patients undergoing surgery, preoperative passionflower use reduced anxiety . In healthy adults, consumption of a low-dose passionflower tea produced short-term benefits in sleep quality . Another small study suggests that the effect of passionflower is comparable to a prescription drug in the treatment of ADHD When used concurrently, passionflower was shown to enhance the pharmacologic effects of St. John’s wort Theoretically, passionflower may potentiate the sedative effect of central nervous system depressants including benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and alcohol . Due to potential adverse effects, passionflower should be avoided during pregnancy ",
      "Purported Uses2": [
        "Benzodiazepine withdrawal",
        "Drug withdrawal symptoms",
        "Epilepsy",
        "Insomnia",
        "Neuralgia",
        "Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)"
      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "The alkaloid constituents harman and harmaline are thought to produce monoamine oxidase inhibition , while maltol and gamma-pyrone derivatives cause activation of gamma amino butyric acid (GABA) receptors that may account for anxiolytic and sedative properties . Chrysin has also been identified among the bioactive metabolites with central nervous system (CNS) suppression activity In vitro, modulation of the GABA system by passionflower includes affinity to GABA(A) and GABA(B) receptors, and effects on GABA uptake . Antiradical activities observed are attributed to flavonoids such as isovitexin . An isolated benzoflavone moiety is suspected as being the strongest aromatase inhibitor in passionflower, although the flavone chrysin also has these properties In an animal reproductive and developmental study, passionflower produced sexual behavioral disruption in male adult rats that was not accompanied by alterations in plasma testosterone levels, reproductive-related organs, and glands weights or sperm count, and was potentially attributed to aromatase inhibition . In seizure models, protection against post-ictal depression not seen with diazepam controls point to activity from metabolites in passionflower rather than as a result of its seizure suppression effects Passionflower also exhibits mild anti-inflammatory activity. An ethanolic extract of passionflower reduced carrageenan-induced edema, leukocyte migration, and granuloma formation in mice, although the effect was less than that seen with aspirin ",
      "Contraindications": "Pregnancy: In lab studies passionflower produced sexual behavioral disruption . Some constituents in passionflower may cause uterine contractions  ",
      "Adverse Reactions": "Dizziness, sedation, ataxia, allergic reaction, and impaired cognitive function Large doses may result in central nervous system depression and bradycardia, prolonged QTc and ventricular tachycardia Case reports Nausea, vomiting, bradycardia, and abnormal electrocardiogram: ECG changes included non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, QTc prolongation, and nonspecific ST-T wave changes in a 34-year-old woman requiring hospital admission Hand tremors, dizziness, throbbing and muscular fatigue: In a patient who self-medicated with valerian and passionflower while on lorazepam treatment. An additive or synergistic effect is suspected to have caused these symptoms ",
      "Herb-Drug Interactions": "Pentobarbital: Passionflower may potentiate the effects of pentobarbital Benzodiazepines: Passionflower may increase the sedative effects of benzodiazepines by increasing the binding activity of benzodiazepines to GABA receptors Drugs that prolong the QT interval (eg, azithromycin, dasatinib, fingolimod): The pharmacologic profile of passionflower also suggests prolonged QT interval with large doses , and it is not known whether passionflower may have added cardiac effects with these medications.Herb-Herb Interaction\nSt. John’s wort: In antidepressant models, passionflower was shown to enhance the potency of St. John’s wort ",

      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "Lapachol and beta-lapachone, isolated from the inner bark of trees used to produce Pau d’arco, are thought to be the active constituents that are responsible for its pharmacological activities . Beta-lapachone downregulates cyclooxygenase (COX-2) and telomerase activities . It also induces apoptosis in cancer cells via mitochondrial signaling  or by activating caspases . The antimetastatic activity of beta-lapachone occurs by inducing Egr-1, known to suppress metastasis, thereby decreasing the invasive ability of cancer cells . A water extract of Taheebo showed anti-proliferative effects on hormone-sensitive MCF7 breast cancer cells by modulating gene expression, thereby interfering with cell cycle progression. At high doses, it also has anti-estrogenic effects through the inhibition of estrogen receptor signaling . A methanolic extract of taheebo inhibited cell proliferation through the extracelluar signal regulated kinase (ERK1/2) mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway Lapachol’s anticoagulant activity is due to the inhibition of vitamin K epoxide and quinone reductases, an action similar to that of warfarin However, it is important to note that the clinical effects of Pau d’arco are difficult to predict because they are influenced by several factors including variation in plant species or plant parts, extraction methods, bioavailability of the active compounds, dosages and routes of administration.",
      "Adverse Reactions": "Reported: Nausea, vomiting, urine discoloration Anemia: Animal studies showed that large, chronic dosing of lapachol can cause anemia Reproductive toxicity: Short-term administration of lapachol caused significant reduction in the weight of seminal vesicle \nLapachol also has fetotoxic effects , and oral administration of lapachol caused chromosomal abnormalities ",

      "How It Works": "Although PC-SPES has been studied in prostate cancer patients, the product was recalled due to product contamination.\nPC-SPES is an herbal formula containing 8 herbs (reishi mushroombaikal skullcap, rabdosia, dyer’s woadchrysanthemumsaw palmettoPanax ginseng, and licorice.) Scientists do not know which substances in PC-SPES account for its activity. No single botanical or chemical extract appears responsible for the overall effects of this product. Laboratory tests have analyzed the makeup of PC-SPES and have identified estrogen-like compounds that suppress growth and proliferation of human tumor cell lines on contact, including breast, colon, and hormone-dependent and -independent prostate cancers. PC-SPES appears to interfere with the process of tumor cell division and also causes tumor cell death when cells are exposed to it long enough. The ability of PC-SPES to kill cancer cells may be due to alteration of specific genes involved in regulating cell cycle, structure, and response to androgens, such as testosterone. However, this effect has not been confirmed in humans.PC-SPES used in clinical trials has been found to contain small amounts of prescription drugs including diethylstibestrol and ethinyl estradiol. It is unclear whether these agents account for its anticancer effects.",
      "Purported Uses": [
        [
          "To treat prostate cancer",

      "Clinical Summary": "PC-SPES is a supplement consisting of eight herbs: reishi mushroombaikal skullcap, rabdosia, dyer’s woadchrysanthemumsaw palmettoPanax ginseng, and licorice. Patients use it to treat prostate cancer. In vitro testing reveals suppression of human tumor cell lines, including both androgen-sensitive and -insensitive prostate cancers . It is thought that PC-SPES contains phytoestrogens  and other undefined components that contribute to its activity.Published studies have documented efficacy of PC-SPES , resulting in significant decreases in androgen and PSA levels. PC-SPES also demonstrated growth inhibition in a paclitaxel-resistant head and neck cancer cell line, although primary mucosal keratinocytes were less sensitive Concerns about contamination with diethylstilbestrol, warfarin, and alprazolam resulted in a voluntary recall of PC-SPES by the manufacturer in 2002.Based on the preclinical head and neck study, an evaluation of a similar formulation known as Prostaprotect, was also found to exert activity in paclitaxel-resistant cells . In contrast to PC-SPES, saw palmetto was replaced in this new formulation by an extract of pygeum , which is also used to alleviate prostatic hyperplasia symptoms. However, no clinical studies of this product have been conducted and there is a paucity of preclinical data.",
      "Purported Uses2": [
        "Prostate cancer"
      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "Laboratory analyses of PC-SPES indicate the presence of estrogenic organic compounds different from diethylstilbestrol, estrone, and estradiol. In vitro testing of this extract shows suppressed cell proliferation and reduced clonogenicity in human tumor cell lines, including prostate, breast, and colon. The predominant cell cycle effect induced by PC-SPES is prolongation of G1 phase; however, apoptosis was observed after exposure of tumor cells to PC-SPES for 48 hours or longer. PC-SPES also inhibits proliferation of LNCaP prostate cell lines, associated with a 60–70% downregulation of the proliferating cell nuclear antigen. Preliminary studies evaluating the viability of prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP, LNCaP apoptosis-resistant derivative, LNCaP-bcl-2, PC3, and DU145 at three concentrations of PC-SPES show inhibited growth at concentrations of 4 mcg/mL or less. Another recent in vitro study indicates its cytotoxicity may be due to alteration of specific gene expressions involved in regulating the cell cycle, cell structure, and androgen response. No single botanical or chemical extract appears responsible for the overall effects of this product. PC-SPES batches used in clinical studies had been found to contain small amounts of diethylstibestrol and ethinyl estradiol, but it is unclear whether these agents account for its anticancer effects.",

Pectin is used as a gelling agent in food. It is also used as a remedy for diarrhea and for lowering cholesterol. Modified Citrus Pectin (MCP) is an altered form of pectin that has shorter carbohydrate chains and is claimed to be better absorbed by the body. In vitro and animal studies show that pectin induces apoptosis in colonic adenocarcinoma cells  and has antiproliferative , anticancer  and antimetastatic effects \nPreliminary clinical data suggest that pectin is beneficial in treating diarrhea  and in reducing the level of toxic heavy metals . Pectin is also effective against hypercholesterolemia , but a recent study showed that the source and type of pectin influence its activity Pectin has been promoted for reducing the risk of colon cancer and for reducing damage from radiation therapy but there is insufficient scientific evidence to support these uses.

Binding of MCP to galectin-3 was shown to inhibit tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis in vivo. MCP is thought to render galectin-3 incapable of binding its receptors that would result in angiogenesis . Galectin-3 is also found on prostate cancer cells and in prostate tissue. In another study, MCP was shown to increase the doubling time of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) presumably by binding galectin-3 . Pectin was also shown to induce apoptosis in adenocarcinoma cells in vitro via caspase-3 activity resulting in DNA degradation . Pectin-supplemented diet was shown to exert antiproliferative effects in mouse distal colon during colonic hyperplasia . It also lowered cholesterol in patients with hypercholesterolemia.",

      "How It Works": "Pennyroyal is an extremely toxic herb that has caused multi-organ failure and death in several people.\nPennyroyal is a flowering plant that was used in folk medicine to treat various minor ailments, including colic and bronchitis, but is better known for its abortion-inducing effects. Scientists are unsure exactly how pennyroyal exerts these effects (which, it should be noted, have not been consistently shown to occur), but it is thought that the herb causes irritation of the uterus, leading to contractions. However, lethal doses are necessary for this to occur, injuring or killing the mother as well as the fetus. The extensive toxicity of pennyroyal is due to a substance called pugelone, which is metabolized in the liver to highly toxic molecules that cause tissue damage in the internal organs. Studies in both animals and humans show that pulegone is directly toxic to the nervous system.",

There are several reports of young women who took pennyroyal oil for its abortion-inducing effects and died of multi-organ failure. One infant given pennyroyal tea for respiratory infections died from organ failure."

      "Scientific Name": "Mentha pulegium, Hedeoma pulegioides",
      "Clinical Summary": "An essential oil or tea derived from the leaves and flowering tops of the plant, pennyroyal is used in folklore medicine to induce abortion, alleviate menstrual symptoms, to treat inflammatory conditions, chronic bronchitis, minor ailments and colic in infants. Small amounts of the oil are approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use as a flavoring agent.Pennyroyal oil contains several monoterpenes, principally pulegone, which has known toxic effects on the liver and lungs. Oxidative metabolites of pugelone, such as menthofuran, are oxidized further by cytochrome P450 to reactive intermediates that form adducts with cellular proteins and cause organ damage \nIngestion of pennyroyal oil in adults or tea in children causes severe toxicity , including hepatic failure, acute renal failure, coagulopathies, metabolic acidosis, GI hemorrhage, pulmonary congestion with consolidation, cerebral edema, seizures, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and death.",

      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "Pennyroyal’s abortifacient properties are thought to be due to irritation of the uterus, causing contractions, but lethal doses are necessary for this to occur and the effect is inconsistent. Pennyroyal’s mint properties, attributable to the menthol component, theoretically may act in dilating respiratory passages in bronchitis or asthma when consumed as a tea . European and American pennyroyal oil consist of 80-90% and 16-30% (R)-(+)-pulegone, respectively, which is oxidized by cytochrome P450 to menthofuran (about 50%) and other toxic metabolites . The menthofuran is further oxidized to an epoxide which is likely the ultimate toxic biological reactive intermediate  that causes liver damage. Animal and human studies also show that pulegone is neurotoxic. Menthofuran is known to decrease glucose-6-phosphatase activity in rat models, causing hypoglycemia ",
      "Warnings": "This botanical contains compounds that are toxic to both animals and humans.",
      "Contraindications": "Due to its abortifacient effects, pennyroyal should not be consumed by pregnant or breast-feeding women.",
      "Adverse Reactions": "Reported: Dizziness, weakness, syncope, hallucinations, abdominal cramps, nausea, GI upset, pupillary changes, hepatotoxicity, renal injury.Toxicity: At least 24 cases of pennyroyal toxicity are in the literature, reporting fulminant hepatic failure, acute renal failure, hypoglycemia, coagulopathy, metabolic acidosis, GI hemorrhage, pulmonary congestion with consolidation, mental status changes, cerebral edema, seizures, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and death. Pennyroyal oil ingestion is treated with gastric lavage, activated charcoal, and N-acetylcysteine in patients evaluated soon after ingestion.Case Report (Oil): A 24-year-old woman ingested pennyroyal extract for over 2 weeks and, after acute ingestion, developed abdominal cramps, chills, vomiting, syncope, cardiopulmonary arrest and multiorgan failure leading to coma and death. Exploratory laparotomy showed a hemorrhagic ectopic pregnancy . An 18-year old ingested 30 ml of pennyroyal oil and developed abdominal pain, vomiting, coagulopathy, and died one week later from cardiopulmonary arrest and multiple organ failure Case Report (Tea): An 8-week old boy, after ingesting 120 ml of homegrown pennyroyal mint tea to treat a suspected infection, experienced multiple organ failure, including confluent hepatocellular necrosis, kidney hemorrhage and necrosis, bilateral lung consolidation with diffuse alveolar damage and hemorrhage, and diffuse cerebral edema with acute ischemic necrosis and isolated vacuolation of the midbrain. The infant died 4 days after admission. A 6-month old boy developed acute hepatic injury, seizures, and sinus hemorrhage after regular consumption of pennyroyal tea, and recovered after 2 months of hospitalization ",

Peppermint is also widely used as flavoring in candies and oral hygiene products.Current evidence indicates effectiveness of peppermint in alleviating headaches , respiratory problems , irritable bowel syndrome , dyspepsia, gastric spasm, and general gastrointestinal discomfort . Pretreatment with peppermint oil capsules was also found effective in decreasing pain and in reducing colonic spasms in patients during colonoscopy More recently, studies have suggested a role for peppermint in cancer treatment. A significant anti-tumorigenic potential against several human cancer cell lines has been reported in vitro . Animal studies also indicate peppermint’s effectiveness against radiation-induced testicular damage , benzo[a]pyrene-induced lung carcinogenicity  in mice, and its preventive effects against carcinogenesis induced by tobacco products in hamsters .

    "details": {
      "How It Works": "A specific form ofperillyl alcohol may be helpful in palliative care patients with recurrent gliomas. However, oral forms were not effective in several cancers and were accompanied by adverse side effects.Perillyl alcohol (POH) is a natural substance called a monoterpene, isolated from the essential oils of lavenderpeppermint, spearmint, cherries, celery seeds, and several other plants. Laboratory evidence suggests that it interferes with the replication of dividing cells. POH has shown antitumor activity against a range of cancer types including pancreatic, lung, colon, and liver cancers in laboratory and animal studies, but these results have not yet translated into benefits in humans. Clinical trials of oral POH for various cancers including breast, prostate, and ovarian cancers did not find benefit and also noted adverse side effects, even after modifying dosing regimens to try to improve effectiveness and tolerability. However, an inhaled form of POH has shown preliminary evidence of safety and effectiveness in patients with recurrent gliomas. In addition, other purified forms are being studied as chemical modifiers of established drugs used to treat cancer in order to improve outcomes.",
      "Purported Uses": [
        [
          "To prevent and treat cancer",
          "POH developed as a nasal spray has shown initial evidence of safety and effectiveness in palliative care patients with recurrent gliomas. A study of topical POH applied to sun-damaged skin did not suggest it could prevent skin cancers. Oral POH has yet to suggest benefit in humans and was also associated with adverse side effects."
        ]
      ],
      "Side Effects": [
        "Oral POH: nausea, unpleasant taste, gastrointestinal distress, feeling full after eating a small amount of food, fatigue\n\tToxicity can develop at high doses including nausea, fatigue, diarrhea, low blood potassium levels, inflamed oral mucous membranes, and loss of appetite. There have also been cases of vomiting, low white blood cell counts, and inflammation of the pancreas.",
        "Intranasal POH: Initial studies have shown good tolerability and no adverse effects."
      ],
      "Special Point": "Natural products such as tart cherry juice may contain POH. However, the POH that occurs in natural products are different from the highly purified forms that are being used for research and clinical trial purposes to determine safety and efficacy.",
      "Scientific Name": "p-metha,1,7-diene-6-ol, 4-isopropenyl-cyclohexenecarbinol",
      "Clinical Summary": "Perillyl alcohol (POH) is a naturally occurring monoterpene derived from the essential oils of various botanicals including lavenderpeppermint, cherries, sage, and lemongrass. It has been used topically as a mosquito repellant and in toiletries, and may be touted as a constituent of natural products such as tart cherry juice.In vitro studies show that POH has antiangiogenesis  and anticancer effects. Early animal studies also suggest tumor inhibition and regression In human studies, oral POH did not benefit patients with prostate , ovarian , or breast cancers . Another study attempting to achieve higher daily oral doses or better long-term tolerability in a variety of malignant tumors found no significant advantages with interrupted administration over continuous dosing schedules . Topical POH also did not show chemopreventive effects in subjects with skin damage . These delivery methods were consequently abandoned due to either dose-limiting side effects and/or lack of efficacy . More recent preliminary studies found intranasal POH delivery in patients with malignant gliomas to be well-tolerated and effective, with one study reporting tumor size regression , and another reporting increased overall survival and no side effects after long-term use . Confirmatory studies are needed.POH is also in preclinical development as part of a novel drug to improve upon the effects of temozolomide (TMZ), which is used to treat a variety of cancers. TMZ conjugated to POH (TMZ-POH) increased anticancer activity in several breast cancer cell lines including those resistant to TMZ . Animal models also suggest its potential for brain-targeted breast cancer metastases , TMZ-resistant gliomas , O6-methyl-guanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) melanomas , and nasopharyngeal carcinomas  versus TMZ alone or simply a mixture of TMZ and POH. Amino-modified POH derivatives are also being evaluated and have shown anticancer activity in human lung cancer, melanoma, and fibrosarcoma cells The POH that may occur in natural products are different from their scientifically studied counterparts, which are extracted from plants or developed synthetically into highly purified forms and are being used for research and clinical trial purposes to determine safety and efficacy.",
      "Purported Uses2": [
        "Cancer prevention",
        "Cancer treatment"
      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "Perillyl alcohol metabolites perillic acid and dihydroperillic acid may prevent tumor growth through inhibition of p21-dependent signaling and apoptosis resulting from induction of the transforming growth factor beta-signaling pathway . These metabolites also induce G1 cell cycle arrest, inhibit posttranslational modification of signal transduction proteins, and cause differential expression of cell cycle- and apoptosis-related genes . POH may also affect Ras signaling pathways  and Na/K-ATPase inhibition . In addition, some POH glycosides, most particularly POH 4’-azido-D-glucoside (PG9), are identified as having improved antiproliferative activity and inhibition of S6 ribosomal protein phosphorylation Intranasal POH may be more successful than dose-limiting oral POH because it crosses the blood-brain barrier to enter the central nervous system, eliminating the need for systemic delivery and reducing unwanted systemic side effects In breast cancer cell lines and animal models, the more efficient DNA damage and cell death that occurs with the novel compound TMZ-POH versus TMZ alone was due to the increased biologic half-life acquired with POH linkage, providing more opportunity for placement of cytotoxic DNA lesions . A combination of POH and lovastatin, which may also reduce glioma risk, impaired mevalonate- and Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway regulation in glioblastoma cells ",
      "Adverse Reactions": "Common (oral): nausea, unpleasant taste, gastrointestinal distress, early satiety, fatigue Rare (oral): vomiting At 1200 mg/m/day: one instance of hypokalemia (low potassium levels) At 1600 mg/m/dose: gr 3 hypokalemia with course 2; acute pancreatitis in a patient with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma during course 6 At 2000 mg/m/dose: gr 2–3 hypokalemia over 2 courses At >2800 mg/m/day: nausea, fatigue, diarrhea, hypokalemia, stomatitis, and anorexia At high doses on a tid schedule: gr 3 neutropenia in 2 heavily treated ovarian cancer patients ",

      "Clinical Summary": "Petiveria alliacea, commonly known as Anamu, is a perennial shrub prevalent in South and Central America, and in some areas of Africa and the southeastern United States. It has been widely used in folk medicine to treat inflammation, infection, and as an anticancer agent. Extracts of this herb demonstrated antimicrobial, antifungal , antiviral , antiprotozoal , and immunomodulatory  properties in vitro. Data on its cytotoxic effects are conflicting The whole plant extracts cause anxiolytic effects, whereas an extract of aerial parts showed anxiogenic properties , and root extracts showed anticonvulsant effects in mice . Although petiveria extract exhibited anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects in animals , it did not show any benefits in patients with osteoarthritis compared with placebo \nIn vitro and in vivo assays showed that petiveria has mutagenic effects . More studies are needed to evaluate its traditional uses.",

      "Mechanism of Action": "Dibenzyl trisulphide, one of the active ingredients of Petiveria alliacea, causes disassembly of microtubules in neuroblastoma cells resulting in inhibition of cell proliferation . Oral administration of P. alliacea root extract to rats resulted in reduced migration of neutrophils, mononuclear cells and eosinophils to the site of inflammation, thereby exerting an anti-inflammatory effect P. alliacea root extract exhibited antimitotic effect in vivo  and extracts from its leaves and stems showed hypoglycemic effects in mice . The polysulphides of P. alliacea were shown to have antifungal and antibacterial activities . Methanolic extracts of P. alliacea showed active inhibition of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) replication in vitro P. alliacea also demonstrates anticancer effects. In one study, it was shown to mediate changes in glycolytic enzyme expression causing a decrease in glucose uptake and lactate production, thereby inducing apoptosis in breast adenocarcinoma cells ",

      "Side Effects": "P. linteus use resulted in worsening of an autoimmune condition called pemphigus that is characterized by blisters on the skin and mucous membranes and by itching or burning.",
      "Scientific Name": "Phellinus linteus",
      "Clinical Summary": "Phellinus linteus (PL) is a yellow, bitter-tasting mushroom that grows on mulberry trees. It is used in traditional medicine in Asia where it is often mixed with other medicinal mushrooms, such as Reishi and Maitake, and promoted as an adjunctive treatment during cancer therapy. Some preparations of PL are used to prevent wrinkles and aging but clinical evidence is lacking. The polysaccharide-protein complexes found in PL were shown to have immunomodulating effects . The polyphenolic constituent demonstrated anti-inflammatory properties, which may protect against injury and other syndromes involving infarcts, hematomas or hemorrhages in animal models . Other constituents, such as interfungins A, help prevent protein modification in hyperglycemic state, and may benefit diabetics \nPL is being researched for its potential chemoprotective effects. A number of in vitro and animal studies suggest that it has anti-angiogenic, antioxidant, and xanthine oxidase inhibition properties . Anticancer effects against breast , colon , liver , lung , oral , prostate  and skin cancers  have also been reported.While there are case reports of tumor regression following consumption of PL , large-scale clinical studies have yet to be conducted to examine its efficacy as a cancer treatment.",

        "Anti-hemorrhagic",
        "Anti-inflammatory",
        "Cancer treatment and prevention"
      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "The polysaccharide-protein complexes found in PL have immunomodulating , anti-angiogenic, and antioxidant and xanthine oxidase inhibition effects . Additionally, the furopyranone compounds inhibit protein glycation, which may aid in treatment and prevention of diabetic complications . In non-obese diabetic mice, a polysaccharide extract from PL enhanced function of macrophages, dendritic cells, NK cells, T cells and B cells, prevented inflammation by inhibiting IFN-gamma, IL-2 and TNF-alpha by TH1 cells and macrophages; it also upregulated IL-4 expression in TH2 cells. These effects may help prevent diabetes The anti-inflammatory activities of inotilone, a compound isolated from PL might be due to reduced levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), COX-2, NF-κB, and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9, and via increased activities of catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) through the suppression of TNF-α and nitric oxide (NO) Hispidin, a phenolic compound present in PL, was shown to protect against peroxynitrite-mediated cytotoxicity, DNA damage and hydroxyl radical formation . PL also inhibited proliferation of SW480, a human colon cancer cell line via decreasing Bcl-2 and cyclin B1, and increasing cytochrome C . Another study similarly found that a PL extract induced G0/G1 arrest and apoptosis in human colon carcinoma HT29 cells, through p21(C1P1/WAF1) upregulation, cyclin D1 downregulation, Bcl2 downregulation, release of cytochrome C and activation of caspases 9, 3 and 8 . Decrease in cyclin-dependent kinases CDK2, 4 and 6, and dose-dependent apoptosis of lung cancer cells after treatment with PL were also observed . Further, it suppressed aryl hydrocarbon receptor activity and AhR-dependent gene expression, both pathways activated by cigarette smoking ",
      "Adverse Reactions": "Exacerbation of pemphigus, an autoimmune disorder, was reported following use of PL ",

Pine bark extract may also have antiviral and antimicrobial activities. It inhibits HIV attachment and replication , suppresses encephalomyocarditis virus (EMV) replication , and represses Helicobacter pylori growth and adherence to gastric cells \nPine bark extract has been studied in humans for various conditions. Preliminary research suggests that it reduces menopausal symptoms in peri-menopausal women , relieves symptoms of dysmenorrhea , and improves osteoarthritic symptoms . It is also used to treat skin disorders such as hyperpigmentation , erythema , endometriosis , and systemic lupus erythematosus Pine bark extract can improve endothelial dysfunction  and chronic venous insufficiency . Chewing gum containing pine bark extract may reduce gingival bleeding and plaque accumulation . When used in conjunction with L-arginine, Pycnogenol is effective in improving symptoms of erectile dysfunction . Pycnogenol supplementation also enhanced memory in elderly participants . Studies of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in adults and in children yielded mixed results . A systematic review concluded that large-scale studies are needed to establish the value of Pycnogenol in the treatment of chronic disorders \nIn vitro studies show antimetastatic effects of pine bark extract . Pycnogenol may also protect against cardiotoxicity caused by doxorubicin without antagonizing its cytotoxic activity . Preliminary findings from a study involving cancer patients suggest usefulness of pycnogenol is reducing adverse effects associated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy . Further research is needed.\nAdverse effects may include irritability and decreased energy especially when used for ADHD.",

        "Inflammation"
      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "The primary constituents of pine bark extracts are procyanidins and phenolic acids . Pine bark extract acts as an antioxidant by scavenging reactive oxygen and nitrogen species and suppressing production of peroxides . It increases the activities of antioxidant enzymes by increasing the intracellular glutathione levels . In addition to increasing NO production which induces vasodilation , pine bark extract also blocks the NF-kB activation stimulated by tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and inhibits production of adhesion proteins that cause inflammation and atherosclerosis An in vitro study suggests that Pycnogenol induces apoptosis in human breast cancer cells and not in normal breast cells although the mechanism is not clear . Other in vitro studies have also shown that it reduces neuronal apoptosis, an important feature of Alzheimer’s disease, by decreasing free radical generation . In animal studies, pine bark extract exhibits a protective effect on cardiotoxicity caused by antitumor drugs, such as doxorubicin, due to its ability to act as a free-radical scavenger ",

A few studies suggest that pollen extract may be helpful in relieving both premenstrual and menopausal symptoms. Although the mechanism by which this may occur is not well understood, pollen extract appears not to have hormonal effects. Therefore, it may be useful for breast cancer patients experiencing hot flashes. However, studies in cancer populations are needed to ensure safety, effectiveness, and to confirm that it does not negatively interact with chemotherapy drugs.",

      "Brand Name": "Relizen®, Femal®",
      "Clinical Summary": "Pollen extract is an ingredient in a standardized Swedish natural product that contains both pollen and pistils derived from members of the Poaceae family of grasses. It has been used as an herbal remedy to relieve premenstrual, perimenopausal, and menopausal symptoms such as fatigue, hot flashes, irritability, and sleeplessness. The exact mechanism of action remains unclear. However, in vitro and animal studies did not find estrogenic activity , suggesting it does not work through the modulation of hormones. This is of particular interest among patients with hormone-sensitive cancers who have limited options and may have safety concerns with more conventional methods to address such symptoms.Initial open-label studies suggested that a standardized pollen extract was useful in alleviating premenstrual, perimenopausal, and menopausal symptoms , although one of these studies combined the extract with royal jelly. In a follow-up randomized controlled trial (RCT), pollen extract was found to reduce hot flashes and improve quality of life in menopausal women . A double-blind RCT found a reduction in premenstrual sleep disturbances, which was more pronounced in women who identified irritability as their main symptom No studies have been conducted in cancer populations. Therefore, additional clinical trials are needed to confirm safety and efficacy of pollen extract, including for use among cancer patients.Pollen extract should not be confused with propolis, which is pollen harvested by bees from many different plant families, and may also include other substances such as beeswax.",

      "Mechanism of Action": "There are two active ingredients in the formulation studied: a combined pollen and pistil extract (PI 82, 75%), which contains high levels of superoxide dismutase, and a pure pollen extract (GC FEM, 25%) . PI 82 pollen extracts are derived from Secale cereale (rye grass), Dactylis glomerata (orchard grass), and Pinus silvestris (Scots pine) while the pollen-pistil extract is derived from Zea mays. GC FEM pollen extract is derived from S. cerealeZ. mays, and P. silvestris . The preparation is standardized to contain 14 mg of amino acids per tablet Laboratory studies determined that the pollen extract preparation used in studies contained low concentrations of the phytoestrogens daidzin, daidzein, and genistin, that were considered to be subeffective. These studies also did not detect genistein, formononetin, or biochanin A . In vitro, purified Swedish pollen extract did not show inhibition of the cytochrome P450 2D6 enzyme . In addition, animal studies indicate that the pollen extract formulation at high doses did not cause uterine growth in immature female rats, suggesting no estrogenic effects The exact mechanism for reduction of menopausal symptoms remains unclear but one study suggests that the antioxidant properties of the ingredients may play a role ",

In a study of postmenopausal women, intake of pomegranate seed oil did not reduce hot flashes Pomegranate juice has been shown to suppress inflammatory cell signaling , inhibit prostate tumor growth and lower serum PSA levels , and also inhibit aromatase activity, endogenous estrogen biosynthesis and breast cancer cell proliferation  in vitro. A pomegranate seed extract alleviated ciplatin-induced hepatotoxicity in animal studies . Pomegranate juice was also reported to slow the rate of increase of PSA in men with high PSA levels, but data are conflicting . However, supplementation with a blend of green tea, pomegranate, broccoli and curcumin resulted in a reduction in the rate of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) increase among men with prostate cancer following a PSA relapse post-radical treatment Recent investigations have shown that oral intake of pomegranate extracts modulates gene expression for both osteoclastic and osteogenic processes in postmenopausal women, suggesting a possible role in bone health ; and influences changes in gene expression in colon tissues from colorectal patients . Future studies are needed to determine the implications of such changes.",

      "Mechanism of Action": "Several studies have indicated that pomegranate juice has antioxidant and antiatherosclerotic properties due to the presence of multiple polyphenols such as tannins, flavonols, anthocyanins and ellagic acid. Punicalagin, an ellagitannin, is the most abundant polyphenol that accounts for >50% of the antioxidant activity Studies using animal models indicate that ellagic acid and luteolin, components of pomegranate juice, inhibit metastasis of ovarian cancer by down-regulating matrix metalloproteinases MMP2 and MMP9 ; a pomegranate extract induced apoptosis and impaired metastatis in prostate cancer cells also by down-regulating MMP2/MMP9 along with up-regulating tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase TIMP2 ; and another extract mediated prevention of dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA)-induced mammary carcinogenesis likely involving anti-inflammatory mechanisms via differential regulation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and nuclear factor erythroid 2p45 (NF-E2)-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling . In addition, a pomegranate extract was shown to suppress breast cancer stem cell characteristics by inhibiting the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) . But pomegranate extract can also inhibit aromatase activity and decrease the endogenous synthesis of estrogen Some commercial pomegranate juices are marketed with claims of higher antioxidant activity than green tea and red wine . However such effects could be due to colonic microflora metabolites and not the polyphenols present in the juice ",

      "How It Works": "Probiotics have been shown effective against diarrhea and certain inflammatory disorders. But data from well-designed clinical trials are needed to establish their use.Probiotics are defined by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the World Health Organization as “live microorganisms, which when consumed in adequate amounts, confer a health effect on the host”. Majority of probiotics contain bacteria that produce lactic acid, such as Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, Bifidobacterium, Propionibacterium and Enterococcus or yeasts such as Saccharomyces boulardii that are not harmful.Probiotics have grown popular over the last two decades because they are thought to improve digestion, immune function and nutrient absorption but the most important being the reversal of dysbiosis (changes in the function or composition of gut microbes) that is thought to play a role in the development of many chronic and degenerative diseases. Probiotic supplementation is promoted for the prevention and treatment of inflammatory bowel disease, gastroenteritis, irritable bowel syndrome, allergies, dental cavities, and for the management of diarrhea due to antibiotic use, due to the bacterium Clostridium dificile, and that associated with chemotherapy.Other methods used to change the gut microbiota include “prebiotics” and “fecal microbiota transplantation” (FMT). Prebiotics, also known as functional foods, are non-digestible food ingredients that benefit the host by selectively promoting growth or activity of helpful gut bacteria. Because probiotics are short-lived, prebiotics are sometimes added to probiotics to maintain their levels in the gut. This combination of pro- and prebiotics is called “synbiotic therapy.” FMT involves administration of fecal matter from a healthy donor into a recipient by enema, colonoscopy or through the upper gastrointestinal tract in the form of oral capsules, via nasogastric, nasoduodenal or nasoenteric tube, or by endoscopy.Current evidence indicates that probiotics may be useful for the treatment of some inflammatory disorders, and also have anti-carcinogenic activity. But the drawbacks of the studies include small sample size and poor methodology. Well-designed trials and guidelines are needed to recommend use of probiotics. Probiotics are generally considered safe, but their long-term safety is not known. Bacteremia (presence of bacteria in the blood), fungemia (presence of fungi in the blood), and endocarditis (inflammation in the lining of the heart) have been reported following use in newborns and in immunocompromised individuals.",

      "Clinical Summary": "The term “Probiotic” (Greek for “prolife”) came into being in the 1960s to define substances produced by protozoa, which support the growth of other microorganisms . Following revisions over the years, probiotics are currently defined by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the World Health Organization as “live microorganisms, which when consumed in adequate amounts, confer a health effect on the host” . Most probiotics consist of lactic-acid producing, non-virulent bacteria, such as Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, Bifidobacterium, Propionibacterium and Enterococcus or non-pathogenic yeasts such as Saccharomyces boulardii. Probiotics have gained immense popularity over the last two decades for their perceived health benefits which include improved digestion, immune function and nutrient absorption but the most important being the reversal of dysbiosis (changes in the function or composition of gut microbes or “microbiota”) that is hypothesized to play a role in the development of several chronic and degenerative diseases . Although gut microbiota is known to develop at birth, nutrition, lifestyle, and changes in the host genome during later years can shift its makeup and activity, which in turn influences overall health and the risk of developing disease. Antibiotic use can also disrupt the balance between beneficial and harmful bacteria . Probiotic supplementation is currently promoted for the prevention and treatment of inflammatory bowel disease, gastroenteritis, irritable bowel syndrome, allergies, dental cavities, and for the management of diarrhea induced by antibiotics, by the bacterium Clostridium dificile, and that associated with chemotherapy . However, authoritative guidelines for probiotic use have not yet been established nor is there a consensus about the minimum number of microorganisms needed to derive benefits.Probiotics have been evaluated in randomized controlled trials and the strongest evidence of their effectiveness is for acute infectious diarrhea, the main cause of acute gastroenteritis . Probiotic supplementation also was shown useful in alleviating antibiotic-associated diarrhea . Although small trials indicate effectiveness in the management of Clostridium dificile-associated diarrhea (CDAD), randomized trials did not find any benefit .The role of probiotics in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has been the focus of many studies and available data support their efficacy for pouchitis (inflammation of the ileal pouch in post-colectomy patients). Interestingly, even though a range of products were shown useful in treating and sustaining remissions of mild to moderately active ulcerative colitis, findings of Crohn’s disease are not promising . Based on the association of intestinal bacteria with symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), probiotic supplementation has been explored in a few studies. Although current data are encouraging, well-designed trials to support use are lacking . And analyses of the National Health and Nutrition survey results revealed that consumption of yogurt or probiotics reduces the risk of proteinuric kidney disease , but definitive conclusions about the role of probiotics for the treatment of urinary tract infections  or bacterial vaginosis  are lacking. Probiotic use was also shown to increase resistance to risk factors associated with dental caries in a randomized trial , and to improve memory impairment in a murine model . The utility of probiotics in preventing allergies has been addressed as well, with studies showing a moderate benefit for eczema prevention but not for other allergic conditions . Probiotic supplementation was also shown useful for the reduction of glycemic and inflammatory markers in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease . But evidence to support its role in managing cystic fibrosis is lacking As increasing evidence indicates that gut bacteria are important determinants of metabolic disorders, probiotics are being investigated as a possible therapeutic option. Thus far, beneficial effects have been reported against obesity and diabetes in mice and in humans . Meta analyses suggest that probiotic supplementation helps prevent oral candidiasis in the elderly , may lower fasting blood glucose level in adults  and may also improve lipid metabolism by lowering the levels of LDL and total cholesterol Another important application of probiotic therapy is in pediatrics for the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders and allergies. Meta analyses indicate that enteral supplementation of probiotics is effective in preventing severe necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm infants. And a significant reductionin acute diarrhea was reported in children, independent of the bacterial strains employed . Studies also indicate efficacy of probiotics against antibiotic-associated diarrhea . But available evidence does not support use for allergic diseases , and data are insufficient to assess effects in children with short bowel syndrome, a malabsorption disorder Preliminary studies also suggest that probiotics may have anti-carcinogenic potential. Preclinical data show that oral administration of Lactobacillus casei BL23 has a protective effect against dimethyl hydrazine-induced colorectal cancer , and a probiotic mixture attenuated the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma . Data from a large epidemiological study suggest an association between consumption of non-pasteurized dairy products and lower incidence of colorectal cancer . Probiotics may also aid in controlling symptoms associated with cancer treatments. Results from a systematic review showed a reduction in the severity and frequency of treatment-associated diarrhea, and the need for anti-diarrheal medication in cancer patients following probiotic supplementation . In other studies, perioperative probiotic treatment reduced surgical site infections in patients undergoing colorectal cancer surgery  and improved bowel function . More studies are underway In addition to probiotics, other strategies used to modulate gut microbiota that have recently gained attention include “prebiotics” and “fecal microbiota transplantation” (FMT). Prebiotics, also known as functional foods, are non-digestible food ingredients that benefit the host by selectively promoting growth or activity of helpful gut bacteria. Currently used prebiotics include the fructans inulin and fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS), galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS), and lactulose. A few studies have evaluated the utility of prebiotics for IBS but data are conflicting . Because probiotics are short-lived, prebiotics are being co-administered to maintain their levels in the gut. This combination of pro- and prebiotics is called “synbiotic therapy” that has been shown useful in controlling symptoms associated with IBS . FMT involves administration of fecal matter from a healthy donor into a recipient by enema, colonoscopy or through the upper gastrointestinal tract in the form of oral capsules, via nasogastric, nasoduodenal or nasoenteric tube, or by endoscopy, to restore normal gut flora. Some studies indicate that FMT might benefit IBS patients, but the quality of evidence is low. Further research is needed Although an increasing number of studies suggest that probiotics improve health by inducing favorable changes in the intestinal bacteria, the overall evidence to support their use is limited due to small sample size, poor methodology, variation in the species and strains of bacteria, and in the dosage and duration of administration. Variation in the response to probiotics is also an important factor to consider because genes that respond to probiotic intake were shown to be strain-specific  and to cluster according to the individual and not by intervention . Well-designed studies and specific recommendations are needed to establish probiotic use for different age groups and disorders.Probiotics are generally considered safe, but their long-term safety has not been determined. Bacteremia, fungemia, and endocarditis have been reported following use in newborns and in immunocompromised individuals.",

      "Mechanism of Action": "Suggested mechanisms by which probiotics influence colonization in the gut include production of inhibitory compounds to suppress the growth of pathogenic microorganisms, and production of substrates to promote the growth of beneficial bacteria. Probiotics can also indirectly influence shifts in microbiota by interacting with the mucosal system, which affects systemic immunity; and by reducing pro-inflammatory markers implicated in many disorders Studies using murine models indicate that administration of S. boulardii to type-2 diabetic and obese mice resulted in reduced inflammation, body weight, fat mass, and hepatic steatosis, along with decreased bacterial population that has been previously associated with obesity and type-2 diabetes . Probiotic treatment also affected a reduction in food intake and an improvement in glucose tolerance via release of the hormone glucagon-like protein-1 (GLP-1), a physiological regulator of appetite and food intake Immunomodulation is one of the ways in which probiotics are thought to influence host health. A subspecies of Bifidobacterium longum prevented Salmonella-associated infection in mice by inducing T-regulatory cells and by attenuating the activation of nuclear factor-kappa B, which plays a role in the expression of pro-inflammatory genes . Induction of T-regulatory cells was also shown in humans along with a reduction in pro-inflammatory biomarkers . In addition probiotic administration was shown to reduce pain perception, and to induce changes in the colonic expression of genes that mediate pain and inflammation . And a probiotic mixture reduced the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma by shifting the gut microbes toward beneficial bacteria, which produce anti-inflammatory metabolites . Protective effects of probiotics were also reported in a murine model of mammary carcinogenesis. Oral administration of a supplement containing Lactobacillus reuteri resulted in inhibition of mammary tumor formation by triggering CD4+/CD25+ lymphocytes, which play a critical role in controlling immune responses. ",

      "How It Works": "A few studies have investigated the efficacy of propolis in treating various conditions. However, further study is needed to determine whether propolis is an effective treatment for any of them. Propolis is a mixture of pollen, beeswax, and resin that is collected by honeybees from the buds and sap of certain trees and plants. It has been used in folk medicine and in food and drinks to improve health and prevent disease. Propolis is thought to be effective against cancer, diabetes, heart disease, infections, and inflammation. However, anticancer effects have not been confirmed in humans. Preliminary studies on the effect of topical propolis-containing products for cancer treatment-related oral ulcerations are mixed and more study is needed. In some instances propolis may actually have toxic effects.Bee pollen, found in propolis, is a mixture of plant pollens, nectar, and bee secretions that bees form into granules to store as food. It is claimed as a “cure all” by some and is thought to have antiaging and stamina-increasing properties, as well as antioxidant effects. Bee pollen has been used to treat chronic inflammation of the prostate, as well as other conditions. However, aside from its nutritional value, clinical data show that the benefits of bee pollen are limited.\nAllergic reactions to propolis and bee pollen have been reported. Therefore, patients who are allergic to bee venom (ie, bee stings), honey, ragweed, or chrysanthemum should not take either of these supplements. Bee pollen may increase the side effect of warfarin, a blood thinning drug.",

      "Special Point": "Propolis is not a recommended treatment for ear infections. If an ear infection is suspected, a physician should be immediately consulted for advice regarding an appropriate treatment.",
      "Clinical Summary": "Propolis is a resinous mixture of pollen and beeswax collected by honeybees from the buds and exudates of certain trees and plants . It has been used in folk medicine and in food and beverages to improve health and prevent disease. Propolis is thought to have antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, immunostimulatory, antiproliferative, vasomodulatory, cardioprotective, and radioprotective properties In vitro studies demonstrate synergistic antimicrobial effects when propolis is used with honey or ethyl alcohol  . Propolis also enhanced the antitumor effects of temozolomide in human glioblastoma cell lines . Another study found propolis to have greater cytotoxic activity against human lung adenocarcinoma and fibrosarcoma cells compared with 5-fluorouracil . Propolis and several of its constituents demonstrated anticancer activities in several human cancer cell lines In animal models, propolis and its constituents have demonstrated cardiovascular , wound-healing , and antitumor activities Despite the number of laboratory studies, very few clinical trials of propolis have been conducted. Topical propolis extract may be helpful in treat fungal foot infections, but confirmatory studies are needed . A pilot study suggests ethanolic propolis extract reduces microbial count and improves symptoms from periodontal treatment . Clinical data also show propolis to be an effective adjuvant treatment for asthma , and to treat plane and common warts . A propolis/zinc suspension reduced the number of acute otitis media infections in children Only a few trials evaluate propolis for cancer and treatment-related mucositis. In a pilot randomized placebo-controlled double-blind study, supplemental propolis was not effective for colon cancer prevention and suggested negative effects on muscle tissues including myocardial cells . The effects of propolis on chemotherapy-induced mucositis are thus far equivocal with results from only two small double-blind controlled trials: one in adults with grade 2/3 mucositis found benefits with both the topical application of honey and a proprietary mixture of honey, olive oil-propolis extract, and beeswax compared with controls , but another in pediatric patients with severe mucositis self-administering topical propolis alone did not find benefit . An open-label study evaluating a mucoadhesive propolis gel for mucositis did find benefit, but confirmatory studies are needed Bee pollen, a constituent of propolis, is a mixture of plant pollens, nectar, and bee saliva that bees form into granules to store as food . It is claimed as a “cure all” by some and is touted for its antiaging and stamina-increasing properties, antioxidant effects, and for chronic prostatitis, among other conditions. Aside from its nutritional value, clinical data show that bee pollen has limited benefits in improving athletic performance The use of propolis and bee pollen is relatively benign. However, hypersensitivity reactions to each of these supplements have been reported.In addition, although a number of laboratory studies indicate anticancer effects, propolis or its constituents may also act as pro-oxidants , produce cytotoxic effects in normal cells , and/or have mutagenic activity  under certain circumstances indicating that risk versus benefit also needs further evaluation.",

      "Mechanism of Action": "In vitro studies have identified a number of active propolis constituents and their potential mechanisms. Generally, antimicrobial and antioxidant activities are related to total phenolic contents ; caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) and artepillin C are well-known anti-inflammatory components ; and the main active anticancer constituents are CAPE and chrysin . However, all of these constituents also possess these other characteristics to some degree and vary with geographic origin.CAPE specifically inhibits nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kB) . In human breast cancer cells, it also inhibits MDR gene expression, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) . CAPE decreased malignancy potential of breast cancer stem cells via inhibition of self-renewal, progenitor formation, and clonal growth, and significantly decreased CD44 expression . CAPE-initiated S- and G2/M-phase cell-cycle arrests and apoptosis in human cervical cancer lines was associated with increased E2F-1 expression The flavonoid chrysin demonstrated photoprotective effects by attenuating UVA- and UVB-induced apoptosis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) expression . Chrysin is an inhibitor of aromatase, an enzyme converting testosterone into estrogen . It is also a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor and inhibited HDAC8 enzymatic activity and tumor growth in human breast cancer cell lines . Chrysin may overcome tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) resistance through Mcl-1 downregulation via STAT3 phosphorylation inhibition . A novel chrysin-organogermanium complex demonstrated inhibitory effects across several human cancer cell lines, with high selectivity between cancer cells and normal cells causing membrane toxicity as demonstrated by decreased cell rigidity and adhesion force, and apoptosis via ROS-dependent mitochondrial pathways The phenolic compound artepillin C is the major constituent that stimulates pungent taste by activating TRPA1 channels . Its immune-modulating effects are attributed to suppression of interleukin (IL)-2, interferon (IFN)-gamma and IL-17 expression in alloreactive CD4 T cells, suggesting its potential in treating graft versus host disease . Artepillin C also sensitizes prostate cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis by engaging both extrinsic receptor-mediated and intrinsic mitochondrial apoptotic pathways . In different tumor cell lines, artepillin C and baccharin were found to be more cytotoxic than propolis, without additive or synergistic effects when combined Induction and/or inhibition of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1) and HIF-1 target genes also been demonstrated with other constituents, including polyphenols, cinnamic acid derivatives baccharin and drupanin, and the flavonoids beturetol and isosakuranetin . Baccharin plus drupanin particularly exerted synergistic growth-inhibitory effects, via intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic signaling transduction and by modulating miRNA expression . Baccharin demonstrates highly selective inhibition of human aldo-keto reductase superfamily (AKR1C3), and suppressed proliferation of PC3 prostate cancer cells stimulated by AKR1C3 overexpression . A synthesized baccharin derivative also demonstrated AKR1C3 inhibition Several compounds mostly belonging to the polycyclic polyprenylated acylphloroglucinols class demonstrated selective targeting of chemotherapy-refractory neuroblastoma cancer stem cells by acting in a pleiotropic manner, including strong disruption of tubulin polymerization and inhibition of replicative enzymes like toposimerases I/II and DNA polymerase In vitro studies of propolis as a whole demonstrate significant free-radical scavenging activity and anti-inflammatory effects by modulating key inflammatory mediators of mRNA transcription, inhibiting specific inflammatory cytokines, and blocking NF-kB activation . Propolis was also found to inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis in human leukemia cells through activation of caspase-3 via the mitochondrial pathway . Apoptotic induction in human breast cancer cells occurs partly through endoplasmic reticulum stress-related signaling , and synergy between propolis and temozolomide in human glioblastoma cell lines is also partly attributed to reduced NF-kB activity In animal models, an ethanolic propolis extract may enhance reverse cholesterol transport via stimulated plasma HDL levels and hepatic ABCA1 and ABCG1 expression . Propolis promotes wound-healing by exerting effects on mast cells that result in downregulation of type I allergy and inflammation  and modifying fibronectin metabolism . Immunomodulatory effects occurred through increased toll-like receptor expression and IL-1beta and IL-6 production . Pretreatment with orally-administered propolis extract reduced doxorubicin-induced oxidative damage to heart mitochondria . Diabetic hepatorenal damage was attentuated via antioxidant activity including free-radical scavenging, and was more pronounced in ethanol than water extracts . In human colon cancer models, oral propolis at doses that caused no detectable toxicity was associated with a decrease in mitotic cells and Ki-67 expression as well as increased endoreduplications and p53 expression, and apoptosis in leukemia cells was associated with downregulation of Bcl-2 and Bax activation ",

      "Clinical Summary": "Proteolytic enzyme (PE) treatments were first popularized in Germany in the 1960s for inflammation, osteoarthritis, autoimmune diseases, and viral infections. The products usually contain a mixture of pancreatin, papain, bromelain, trypsin, and chymotrypsin. Studies done in vitro and in mice have shown that PEs have immunomodulatory and tumoricidal properties . Such effects are thought to result from degradation of abnormal immune complexes.Oral administration of PEs to healthy volunteers resulted in immunomodulatory effects . Although some clinical and epidemiological studies suggest beneficial effects with adjuvant PEs in patients with head and neck cancers , multiple myeloma , breast cancer , and cervical cancer , conflicting data do not support the findings . A randomized controlled trial also determined there is insufficient evidence that these enzymes can prevent mucositis . Further, results from a study involving patients with inoperable pancreatic cancer showed a decrease in overall survival and poorer quality of life with PEs compared with standard gemcitabine-based chemotherapy ",

      "Mechanism of Action": "PEs are thought to exert immunomodulatory effects by causing increased release of reactive oxygen species by polymorphonuclear leukocytes  or by production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukins IL-6 and IL-1B that cause cytotoxic effects . The antiangiogenic effects that the constituent papain exhibits in VEGF-activated human endothelial cells is concentration-dependent and likely due to interference with AKT, MEK1/2 and SAPK/JNK phosphorylation . Bromelain has been shown to lower the tumorigenic/metastatic capacities of sarcoma L-1 cells . It also inhibited glioma cell migration and invasion by affecting expression of integrins, necessary for cellular migration and invasion . In B16 murine melanoma models, PEs inhibited metastasis by reducing expression of CD44 and CD54 molecules ",

      "How It Works": "Quercetin has not been shown to treat cancer or other diseases.\nQuercetin belongs to a family of compounds called bioflavonoids, which are largely responsible for the bright colors and medicinal activities of many plants. Quercetin is the most common bioflavonoid that people consume, and is the most active of the bioflavonoids in laboratory experiments. It is known to act as an antioxidant, neutralizing free radicals that can cause cellular and DNA damage. Quercetin is thought to have anti-inflammatory properties by inhibiting the release of substances that mediate the inflammatory response, such as histamine. Presently, considerable laboratory data support the concept of quercetin as an anticancer compound, but it is still unclear from clinical trials whether this effect occurs in the human body.Because of its antioxidant effects, quercetin may interfere with the actions of certain chemotherapy drugs.",

It is also found in some popular medicinal plants including ginkgo biloba and St. John’s Wort  and is used widely for its antioxidant effects.In vitro data indicate that quercetin has anti-inflammatory and chemopreventive effects . However, quercetin can also act as an anti-apoptotic agent . Studies in animal models have shown its ability to potentiate the antitumor effects of doxorubicin in liver cancer cells, while protecting normal liver cells . Quercetin also demonstrated neuroprotective and antidepressant effects , and exerts pro-oxidant effects by decreasing serum homocysteine levels \nClinical data are limited. In a study of healthy subjects, long-term supplementation with 1000 mg/day quercetin resulted in wide-ranging metabolic effects , but further research is needed to understand the implications. Findings from a systematic review indicate that quercetin obtained from a typical diet may not decrease the risk of ovarian cancer Quercetin was shown to exacerbate estrogen-induced breast tumors in rats , but human data are lacking. Due to its antioxidant effects, quercetin may interfere with the actions of certain chemotherapy drugs.",

Quercetin also exerts anti-inflammatory  and chemopreventive  properties. It also has been shown to have membrane-stabilizing capabilities and inhibits aldose reductase and low-density lipoprotein oxidation . The anti-cancer effects of quercetin are via down regulation of mutant p53 proteins; G1 phase arrest ; tyrosine kinase inhibition ; and down regulation of cell survival, proliferative and anti-apoptotic proteins . Preclinical data support the concept of quercetin as an anti-cancer compound . However, clinical studies that support these uses are few and the results are mixed ",

      "How It Works": "Red clover may help reduce menopausal symptoms.\nRed clover contains compounds known as isoflavones (also found in soy) that show estrogenic activity in laboratory experiments. The isoflavones in red clover include biochanin, daidzein, formononetin and genistein. However, when used in the body, the effects of red clover isoflavones are less clear. They seem to have estrogenic activity, but so far have not been found to relieve menopausal symptoms or cause the endometrium to grow. A study of menopausal women found that red clover extract improved the elasticity of major arteries. Loss of elasticity may occur through menopause. This can contribute to increases in blood pressure that cause the heart to work harder. However, it is not known if red clover can protect against the development of heart disease, and this will require more clinical trials.\nIn laboratory experiments, red clover extract can stimulate the production of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cells, indicating that this herb may not be helpful for women with estrogen-sensitive cancers. Red clover was also shown to stop the growth of normal prostate cells and increase resistance of prostate cancer cells to high-dose radiation in lab experiments.Patients should avoid the use of red clover during radiotherapy for prostate cancer, or if you have estrogen receptor-positive cancers.",

It contains compounds known as isoflavones that act as phytoestrogens. An isoflavone extracts is widely promoted as a dietary supplement to relieve menopausal symptoms.Red clover extract was shown to act as an estrogen agonist and to stimulate proliferation of ER-positive breast cancer cells in vitro . However, Biochinin A, an isoflavone, inhibited aromatase activity and expression , thereby conferring a protective effect. In other studies, isoflavone-enriched extracts demonstrated neuroprotective effects in human cortical neurons  and reduced skin aging in mice by increasing the amount of collagen Clinical data show that supplementation with red clover isoflavones  improves menopausal symptoms compared to placebo . But conclusions from systematic reviews are conflicting: two suggest benefit whereas the third found no evidence of effectiveness . In postmenopausal women, supplementation was shown to alleviate vasomotor and menopausal symptoms . Isoflavones may also improve bone loss . In a trial involving ostopenic postmenopausal women, a red clover extract rich in isoflavone aglycones and probiotics attenuated bone mineral density loss caused by estrogen deficiency and improved bone turnover . Dietary isoflavone intake also improved arterial compliance, an index of the elasticity of large arteries, which is an important cardiovascular risk factor \nOf concern are findings that red clover inhibits the growth of normal prostate cells and increases resistance of prostate cancer cells to high-dose radiation, in vitro . Patients should consult with their physicians before taking red clover supplements.",

Biochanin A, another isoflavone had inhibitory effects on the activity and gene expression of aromatase, an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of androgen to estrogen . In addition, it protected dopaminergic neurons against lipopolysaccharide-induced damage via inhibition of microglial activation and generation of pro-inflammatory factors . An isoflavone-enriched fraction showed neuroprotective activity in human cortical neurons as well, which is thought to be due to antioxidant and estrogenic effects In a murine model, red clover isoflavones reduced skin aging induced by estrogen deprivation following ovariectomy ",

In addition, reishi mushrooms contain sterols that can act as precursors to hormones in the body, along with substances called triterpenes that may have blood pressure-lowering and antiallergy/antihistamine effects. Reishi mushrooms have also been shown to slow the process of blood clotting.\nReishi mushroom can cause toxicity in some immune cells. There are also a few documented cases of liver toxicity.

      "Scientific Name": "Ganoderma lucidum",
      "Clinical Summary": "Reishi mushroom is a fungus that holds an important place in the traditional medical systems of China, Japan, Korea and other Asian countries for its health-promoting effects. It is used as an immunostimulant by patients with HIV and cancer. The active constituents include both beta-glucan polysaccharides and triterpenes.Extracts of reishi were shown to have immunomodulatory , renoprotective , anti-inflammatory , and hepatoprotective  properties both in vitro and in vivo. Clinical studies indicate its benefits in improving lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in men , and in exerting mild antidiabetic effects and improving dyslipidemia . However, randomized controlled trials do not support the use of reishi to address cardiovascular risk factors associated with type 2 diabetes \nReishi has also been studied for its anticancer potential. In vitro and animal studies indicate that it has antiproliferative   and chemopreventive effects , alleviates chemotherapy-induced nausea , enhances the efficacy of radiotherapy , and increases the sensitivity of ovarian cancer cells to cisplatin . It may also help prevent cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity In small clinical studies, reishi increased plasma antioxidant capacity , and enhanced immune responses in cancer patients . In another study, a water-soluble reishi extract appeared to suppress development of colorectal adenomas . Remission of hepatocellular carcinoma was reported in a few cases in a single study . Another case study series suggests a dietary supplement containing Reishi mushroom spore may have a negative effect on gastrointestinal cancer patients . Currently, there is no evidence for the use of reishi in first-line cancer treatment or to prolong long-term cancer survival. However, it may have a role in stimulating host immunity and in enhancing tumor response An in vitro study reported that reishi mushroom extract has toxic effects in leukocytes . There are also a few documented cases of hepatotoxicity . More research is therefore needed to determine its safety and effectiveness as an adjunctive cancer treatment.",

        "Lower urinary tract symptoms"
      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "Beta glucans, polysaccharides present in reishi, have demonstrated antitumor and immunostimulating activities . Its triterpene compounds may inhibit tumor invasion by reducing matrix metalloproteinase expression , and tumor metastases by limiting attachment to endothelial cells . Recent findings indicate that reishi induces natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity against various cancer cell lines via activation of the natural cytotoxic receptors (NKG2D/NCR) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-signaling pathways, which result in exocytosis of perforin and granulysin . Reishi polysaccharides were also shown to increase expression of the major histocompatibility (MHC) class I and costimulatory molecules on melanoma cells, resulting in enhanced antitumor cytotoxicity . In human ovarian cancer cells, reishi inhibits proliferation by suppressing vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression and upregulating connexin 43 expression In other studies reishi increased plasma antioxidant capacity  and enhanced immune response in advance-stage cancer patients . Its extracts also inhibited 5-alpha reductase, an important enzyme that converts testosterone to dihydrotestosterone and is upregulated in benign prostatic hyperplasia ",

      "Side Effects": "Mild to moderate gastrointestinal symptoms and diarrhea at high doses",
      "Scientific Name": "3,5,4'-trihydroxystilbene",
      "Clinical Summary": "Resveratrol is a polyphenolic compound found in many botanical products. Red wine is a natural source of resveratrol as it is rich in grape skin and seeds. However, resveratrol is usually consumed as a dietary supplement for its purported antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. It is also marketed as an anti-aging supplement based on findings that it prolongs the life span of yeast cells . This effect has not yet been demonstrated in humans.A long-term randomized double-blind trial indicates that resveratrol and its major metabolites penetrate the blood-brain barrier to have effects on some biomarkers associated with Alzheimer’s disease , but a meta analysis did not find any significant effect on memory or cognitive performance . Resveratrol is also thought to have cardioprotective effects. Earlier studies found that it reduces the oxidation of low density lipoproteins (LDL), inhibits platelet aggregation, and may protect against atherogenesis . Consumption of wine or a resveratrol-rich grape supplement is associated with reduction in risk of cardiovascular disease  and may help promote circulatory system health . However, it does not decrease the risk of all-cause mortality in older adults . Data on effectiveness of resveratrol against non-alcoholic fatty liver disease are conflicting Resveratrol has also been shown to increase insulin sensitivity in diabetic patients , but supplementation did not improve their metabolic patterns nor reduce C-reactive protein concentrations . Interestingly, conclusions of a meta analysis suggest that high doses of resveratrol are effective in promoting cardiovascular health ; and supplementation improved arterial stiffness and reduced oxidative stress . But data on the effects of resveratrol in controlling metabolic syndromes in obese subjects are inconclusive In vitro and animal studies show that resveratrol inhibits proliferation of cancer cells via different mechanisms . It may also protect against chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity . Further clinical studies are needed to confirm these effects in humans.External application of a resveratrol-containing gel reduced acne symptoms  . Whereas resveratrol is generally safe, high doses can cause gastrointestinal side effects, such as diarrhea. Resveratrol inhibits cytochrome P450 enzymes  and may increase the risk of adverse effects of certain drugs. It also exhibits estrogen-like properties and activates transcription by both estrogen and androgen receptors that can lead to the stimulation of cancer cell proliferation ",

      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "Resveratrol acts as an antioxidant and inhibits oxidation of low density lipoproteins (LDL) , platelet aggregation, and eicosanoid synthesis ; induces nitric oxide (NO) production  and increases arterial blood flow . These actions may contribute to its purported cardiovascular health benefits. Resveratrol also acts as an anti-inflammatory agent by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) activity . It has been shown to decrease C-reactive protein and tumor necrosis factor, and to increase anti-inflammatory interleukin-10 and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 in humans . Other effects include decreasing oxidative stress and improving insulin sensitivity by increasing protein kinase activities . Resveratrol was also shown to decrease circulating insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-I) and IGF-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) levels  which may account for its anti-diabetic effects in humans. Preliminary data suggest that it increases the life span of yeast cells by activating sirtuins , inhibiting human Sirt3 along with stimulating Sirt5 and Sirt1 The neuroprotective effects of resveratrol were shown to be via regulating autophagy and apoptosis mediated by the Akt/mTOR pathway Resveratrol has also been investigated for its anticancer potential. It was found to inhibit proliferation of cancer cells via apoptosis and by exerting anti-estrogenic effects .  Trans-resveratrol appears to decrease methylation of the tumor suppressor gene RASSF-1alpha in women at increased breast cancer risk . In addition, reductions in breast cancer cell migration and invasion were observed after supplementation . Resveratrol growth factor heregulin-beta1 (HRG-beta1) mediated matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9) expressions in human breast cancer cells . But contradictory data show that resveratrol mimics phytoestrogens and could activate genes that are normally regulated by estrogens   or androgens  . In other studies resveratrol helped reduce prostate tumorigenesis through a reduction in prostatic levels of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) activity and increased expression of SIRT1  ; and  modulated steroid hormone-dependent pathways to inhibit prostate cancer cell growth. However, it also increases angiogenesis and inhibits apoptosis in vivo . Further research is needed.Additional findings show that resveratrol downregulates p21 and upregulates cyclin E leading to S-phase accumulation and apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells . It also inhibits CYP1A1, CYP1A2, and CYP1B1 enzymes in tumor cells, perhaps exerting antitumor effects as some of these enzymes are known to be involved in the activation of procarcinogens and toxins . Protective effects of resveratrol against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity are due to upregulation of SIRT1-mediated p53 deacetylation. . Also, it protects against cisplatin-induced cardiotoxicity by suppressing oxidative stress ",
      "Contraindications": "Patients with hormone-sensitive cancers should use caution, as resveratrol exhibits estrogen-like properties and activates transcription by both estrogen and androgen receptors that lead to the stimulation of cancer cell proliferation  ",
      "Adverse Reactions": "Mild to moderate gastrointestinal symptoms and diarrhea at high doses (2.5 and 5 g daily) ",

Rhodiola rosea extract and its key constituent salidroside have been researched, although studies in humans are limited.\nIn vitro studies indicate that salidroside from rhodiola may have neuroprotective  and anticancer effects . In humans, rhodiola supplementation improved physical endurance  and mental performance , reduce stress-induced fatigue , and improved stress symptoms . Preliminary data suggest it may improve symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)  and mild to moderate depression . It was also better tolerated and had fewer side effects than sertraline, although it was also less effective A small study showed that salidroside may have cardioprotective effects in patients with breast cancer receiving epirubicin , but more data are needed to confirm this effect.",
      "Purported Uses2": [
        "Depression",
        "Fatigue",
        "Enhanced mental and physical performance"
      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "In animal models, rhodiola exhibits dose- and time-dependent Th1 and Th2 cytokine modulation effects . Salidroside in rhodiola confers neuroprotective effects via nitric oxide (NO) pathway inhibition in vitro  and induction of antioxidant enzymes thioredoxin, heme oxygenase-1, and peroxiredoxin-I; downregulation of proapoptotic Bax protein; and upregulation of antiapoptotic Bcl-XL proteins . Rhodiola constituents may have synergistic antioxidant activity . In vitro, rhodiola inhibits monoamine oxidases (MAOs) A and B, suggesting that it has antidepressant effects In human breast cancer cells, salidroside induces cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis via mechanisms as yet unidentified, but independent of the estrogen receptor ",

      "Mechanism of Action": "When used in very small doses, the tannin content in rhubarb has a constipating effect. At higher doses, however, the hydrolyzed metabolites of emodin and sennidin stimulate the gastrointestinal tract and produce a laxative effect ; in vitro tests show suppression of TNF, IL-1, and IL-6 production. The actions of anthraquinones on rheinanthrone that is transformed from sennoside A may promote the purgative effects of sennoside A The anti-inflammatory activity of emodin may mediate rhubarb’s hepatoprotective effects in rats with cholestatic hepatitis . Lindeyin, a phenolic gallylglucoside exhibits analgesic and anti-inflammatory activity in animal models. Catechin, epicatechin, procyanidins, and gallylglucose inhibit hyaluronidase in vitro Aloe-emodin also possesses anti-proliferative activity, inducing cell cycle arrest in cancer cell lines . Anthraquinone extracts of rhubarb were shown to induce cytotoxicity in cancer cell lines  and tumor necrosis in mice (sarcoma 37, mammary, and Ehrlich) , although this has not been demonstrated in humans. Another study showed that emodin inhibits human cancer cell invasiveness by specifically antagonizing the adenosine 5’-triphosphate (ATP)-gated Ca(2+)-permeable channel P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) ",

    "details": {
      "How It Works": "Rooibos tea is rich in antioxidants which may protect against cancer and other diseases. However, these effects have not been shown in humans.\nRooibos tea contains compounds that may prevent tumor growth and aging processes, but the specific mechanisms are not known. Further studies are needed. Some compounds isolated from rooibos leaves showed estrogenic activity. Patients with hormone-sensitive cancers should use caution before taking rooibos.",
      "Purported Uses": [
        [

          "To prevent cancer",
          "Rooibos may inhibit tumor growth. Human studies are needed."
        ]
      ],
      "Side Effects": "Rooibos tea may cause liver damage.A study done in male rats indicates that prolonged exposure to rooibos might result in subtle structural changes in the reproductive system and may impair fertility. Intake of large amounts of rooibos may also harm liver and kidney function.",
      "Special Point": "Rooibos tea has antioxidant effects and can interfere with the action of certain chemotherapeutic agents.",
      "Scientific Name": "Aspalathus linearis",
      "Clinical Summary": "Prepared from the dried leaves of the rooibos plant native to South Africa, rooibos tea has grown popular in western countries because it is rich in antioxidants, especially the polyphenols aspalathin and nothofagin , and low in caffeine. It does not contain any catechins, the major flavonoids present in green and black teas In vitro and animal studies have shown that rooibos can modulate immune function , exhibit anti-inflammatory effects , may prevent oxidative stress and play a role in alleviating symptoms associated with type-2 diabetes \nAnimal studies also suggest that it may prevent chromosomal aberrations  and tumor mutagenesis Topically applied rooibos elicits a protective effect against microsomal lipid peroxidation and may help reduce chemical-induced tumor formation . Rooibos also appears to protect against damage caused by radiation . However, these effects have not been confirmed in humans.Rooibos was shown to inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme in healthy volunteers , which may benefit cardiovascular health. Further research is needed.\nBecause compounds isolated from rooibos leaves demonstrated estrogenic activity , patients with hormone-sensitive cancers should use caution before taking rooibos.",

      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "Rooibos was shown to enhance the activity of glutathione-S transferase and UDP-glucuronosyl transferase in rat liver , allowing cells to protect against oxidative stress, and to reduce the effects of hepatocarcinogens. A study of oxidative stress in rats found that serum superoxide dismutase and urine 8-hydroxy-2’-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) concentrations (as markers for DNA damage) were significantly reduced following administration of rooibos . Some studies have shown that the non-oxidized teas have greater antimutagenic effects compared to the oxidized forms. This is probably due to reduction in total polyphenol content with oxidization . The anti-inflammatory effects of rooibos are thought to be due to its inhibition of COX-2 enzyme Rooibos also modulates immune function: It induces higher IL6, IL10 and IFN-gamma levels and increases cell-mediated immunity ; and increases IL2 levels while suppressing IL4 In other studies, rooibos significantly decreased glucocorticoid levels in rats and steroid metabolite ratios linked to metabolic disorders-cortisol:cortisone in humans and CORT:testosterone in rats . Hot water-soluble solids from fermented rooibos inhibited adipogenesis and influenced adipocyte metabolism, suggesting a role in preventing obesity ",

      "Clinical Summary": "Royal jelly is a viscous substance secreted by worker bees and constitutes the essential food for queen bees and their larvae. It is consumed as a health food around the world. It demonstrated vasodilatory, hypotensive, antihypercholesterolemic, antitumor, anti-inflammatory, and estrogenic effects , although its affinity for estrogen receptors is weaker compared with diethylstilbestrol . Animal studies indicate that oral administration of royal jelly may be effective against colitis  and improve testosterone levels Clinical studies have demonstrated that royal jelly lowered total serum lipid levels and total serum cholesterol in individuals with moderately elevated cholesterol levels , and improved erythropoiesis, glucose tolerance and mental health in healthy subjects . Royal jelly also improved type 2 diabetes markers in both men and women , but was not found to be effective in healing diabetic foot ulcers Mid-cycle pericoital intravaginal applications of a combination of Egyptian bee honey and royal jelly improved infertility due to idiopathic asthenozoospermia . Royal jelly also improved premenstrual  and menopausal symptoms . In a combination supplement, it appeared to benefit patients with mild cognitive impairment . In human glioblastoma multiforme cells, royal jelly increased the cytotoxic activity of temozolomide . It also inhibited growth-promoting effects from the environmental estrogen bisphenol A (BPA) on human breast cancer MCF-7 cells in vitro, but did not have this inhibiting effect in the absence of BPA . However, royal jelly was also shown to stimulate MCF-7 cell proliferation which was reversed by tamoxifen . In patients receiving radiotherapy and chemotherapy, royal jelly along with standard mouthwash therapy improved symptoms of oral mucositis and healing time . Another study with a very small sample size also suggests benefit with topical royal jelly in head and neck cancer patients Because royal jelly has estrogenic effects, women with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer should avoid this product. Prostate cancer patients should also use caution as royal jelly increased testosterone levels in animal studies.",

        "Male infertility",
        "Diabetes",
        "Mucositis"
      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "Royal jelly stimulated the production of type 1 collagen and other bone formation activities through its action on osteoblasts . In animal models, anti-inflammatory effects with royal jelly were likely mediated by CD3-, CD5-, CD8- and CD45-positive T-cell immune responses . Protective effects against taxol-induced testicular damage were attributed to improved antioxidant status and E2f1 transcription factor upregulation Various mechanisms for cholesterol-lowering effects have been posited . Royal jelly may decrease reabsorption of cholesterol in the GI tract and increase its excretion in the bile due to the presence of phytosterols, mainly B-sitosterol. Another explanation offered is that royal jelly suppresses hepatic cholesterol synthesis Effects against oxidative stress are attributed to antioxidant peptides . Improved glucose tolerance and erythropoiesis occur from accelerated conversion of DHEA-S to testosterone via activation of 3β-HSD2 and/or 17β-HSD3 . In type 2 diabetic women, royal jelly supplementation reduced hemoglobin A1c and fasting blood glucose levels, increased insulin concentrations, and decreased oxidative stress via improvement of malondialdehyde levels, erythrocyte superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase activities Compounds identified in royal jelly exhibit weak estrogenic activity, but also inhibit binding of estradiol to estrogen receptor beta ",

      "Scientific Name": "Salvia divinorum",
      "Clinical Summary": "Salvia divinorum, a type of sage, has been cultivated by the Mazatec people of Mexico for centuries for use as a hallucinogen during religious ceremonies. Chewing or smoking the leaves can cause depersonalization, visual changes, altered perceptions, and feelings of metamorphosis into objects . The plant was also reported to have antidepressant effects . Salvinorin A, a hallucinogenic compound found in the plant, was shown to have deleterious effects on learning and memory Salvia divinorum has also gained popularity as a recreational drug and is widely available through the internet . Analysis of the 2006-2008 United States National Surveys on Drug Use and Health indicates an 83% increase in the number of salvia users; its use was common among active drug users . Salvia was also among the top five products marketed via the Internet in the UK in 2009 \nThere are adverse effects reported due to abuse. Some states have considered legislation to ban consumption of this herb and it is illegal in Australia, Finland and Denmark. Salvia divinorum should not be confused with the other sages used for cooking and medicinal purposes, such as Salvia officinalis, the common sage.",

      "Clinical Summary": "SAMe is endogenously produced in the human body from adenosine triphosphate and methionine . In the United States, oral supplementation is used primarily to treat depression  and arthritis , but data are conflicting. In patients unresponsive to serotonin reuptake inhibitors, SAMe was effective for major depressive disorder  and improved memory-related cognitive symptoms . Another study suggests benefit compared with escitalopram or placebo , but its therapeutic potential may be greater in men . A recent Cochrane review cites an absence of quality evidence , while a meta-analysis suggests adjunctive potential In other studies, addition of oral SAMe to injected pegylated interferon alpha (pegIFN alpha) and oral ribavirin improved viral response in patients with chronic hepatitis C . Postoperative intravenous SAMe therapy improved residual liver function in patients with cirrhosis . However, in patients with hepatitis C cirrhosis and at elevated risk for hepatocellular carcinoma, oral SAMe did not improve liver function, or reduce injury or oxidative stress . A small open-label study suggests oral SAMe may be useful as adjunctive palliative therapy in patients with advanced biliary tract carcinoma . While generally safe, the therapeutic value of SAMe in chronic liver disease is limited Because it is poorly absorbed, enteric-coated tablets are preferred. Outside the United States, parenteral formulations are used to treat fibromyalgia , osteoarthritis , and tendonitis as well as depression. Adverse effects such as nausea and diarrhea have been reported following initiation of oral therapy.",

        "Osteoarthritis"
      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "SAMe is endogenously produced from adenosine triphosphate and the amino acid methionine. It is a major, ubiquitous methyl donor to a wide variety of molecules , including catecholamines and other biogenic amines, fatty acids, neurotransmitters, nucleic acids, polysaccharides, porphyrins, proteins and membrane phospholipids. Homocysteine is formed through the transsulfuration pathway and is catabolized to cysteine and indirectly to glutathione. Supplementation with SAMe restores hepatic glutathione (GSH) deposits and attenuates liver injury The mechanism by which SAMe might treat depression is unknown, but increased synthesis of neurotransmitters such as serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine, may therefore increase the responsiveness of neurotransmitter receptors and fluidity of cell membranes in the production of phospholipids.",

Some constituents are reported to have hepatoprotective  and cytotoxic  properties.Preliminary findings suggest S. glabra may be useful in the treatment of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura . In animal studies, S. glabra increases platelet production and may play a role in reducing chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia . It also exhibits protective effects against viral pneumonia S. glabra was also found to inhibit tumor growth in human leukemic cell lines S. glabra extract is marketed to cancer patients to relieve fatigue and as an alternative cancer treatment, but it has not been evaluated for these uses in clinical trials. However, it may relieve some cancer treatment-induced symptoms. One human study found it reduced radiation therapy-induced mucositis and xerostomia in patients with advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma . More studies are needed to confirm whether S. glabra can indeed control some cancer treatment-related symptoms and to further validate any antitumor potential.",

      "Mechanism of Action": "In influenza virus animal models, S. glabra improves susceptibility marker levels and inhibits inflammatory cytokines levels through down-regulation of NF-κB protein expression to diminish lung injury. This is in part due to the antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects of major constituents including rosmarinic acid, caffeoylquinic acid, and caffeic acid Caffeic acid 3,4-dihydroxyphenethyl ester (CADPE), a polyphenol component, has indicated some antitumor activity in animal models through inhibition of tumor angiogenesis, induction of cancer cell senescence, and modulation of multiple cellular targets and signal pathways . An ethyl acetate extract of S. glabra inhibits proliferation and viability of human promyelocytic leukemic HL-60 cells by arresting the cell cycle S phase via up-regulation of Bax, a pro-apoptotic factor Generally, active components in S. glabra are more abundant in the stem than leaf and concentrations of constituents vary when examining S. glabra from different provenances.",

      "How It Works": "Saw palmetto was shown in some studies to help relieve the symptoms of benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH), but it has not been shown to prevent or treat prostate cancer.Studies in the laboratory show that saw palmetto works by countering effects of male sex hormones such as testosterone and DHT. It appears to reduce levels of these hormones in body tissues like the prostate. Other studies have noted that saw palmetto reduces the conversion of testosterone to DHT, its more potent form. Saw palmetto berry extracts also reduce inflammation and swelling by preventing the formation of compounds that cause these reactions.\nIn a laboratory study, saw palmetto extract was found to slow the growth of normal prostate cells and increase their sensitivity to radiation, while not affecting prostate cancer cells. Since this may increase the risk of complications, patients should consult with a physician before using saw palmetto supplements during radiation therapy.",

      "Scientific Name": "Serenoa repens",
      "Clinical Summary": "Saw palmetto is a dwarf palm that grows in the coastal lands of North America, West Indies, and Mediterranean countries. The fruits are a rich source of fatty acids and phytosterols and have been used to promote urination, reduce inflammation, and for treatment of conditions such as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).Various heterogeneous extracts of saw palmetto are available, but many basic research and clinical trials used a hexanic extract of S. repens, which has anti-inflammatory, anti-androgenic, and antiproliferative activity . Whereas some data indicate that various saw palmetto extracts improve lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in patients with BPH , conflicting data suggest no such effects . In another large study, a saw palmetto extract did not affect serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) more than placebo even at high doses . Pretreatment with saw palmetto reduced intra- and postoperative complications in patients who underwent transurethral resection of the prostate and open prostatectomy . A saw palmetto extract was found to inhibit growth of normal prostate cells and increase their sensitivity to radiation in vitro, but did not affect malignant prostate cancer cells . A large epidemiologic study did not find associations with the use of saw palmetto and reduced risk of prostate cancer In an exploratory study, a hexanic extract of S. repens demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects in patients with BPH-related LUTS, . In an open-label study, saw palmetto extract plus tamsulosin was found to be more effective than tamsulosin-only to reduce storage symptoms in BPH patients Multi-phytotherapy approaches have also been investigated. One study suggests saw palmetto may benefit patients with chronic bacterial prostatitis when coadministered with nettlecurcumin, and quercitin . Along with selenium and lycopene, saw palmetto exerted anti-inflammatory effects . In addition, patients with LUTS had greater improvement in International Prostate Symptom Scores (IPSS) and increased urine flow with this combination therapy in addition to tamsulosin therapy than with either single therapy Due to the increased risk of normal tissue complications, patients should consult with a physician before using saw palmetto supplements during radiation therapy. There is an ongoing study to determine the effects of saw palmetto on symptom management during radiation therapy ",

        "Inflammation",
        "Promote urination",
        "Prostate cancer"
      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "Studies with a liposterolic extract of saw palmetto berries showed that it reduced tissue uptake of both testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by more than 40%, suggesting antiandrogenic activity . Further, the extract inhibited binding of DHT to its receptor  and blocked conversion of testosterone to DHT by inhibiting 5-alpha-reductase activity . The berries also inhibit cyclooxygenase and 5-lipoxygenase pathways, thereby preventing the biosynthesis of inflammation-producing prostaglandins and leukotrienes . Other possible mechanisms attributed to benefits in BPH include the blocking of estrogen receptor activity in the prostate as well as bladder muscle antispasmodic and anti-inflammatory activities . Possible mechanisms by which saw palmetto could cause hot flashes and vasomotor symptoms especially in children include its antiestrogenic activity influencing physiological endocrine activity and increased availability of sex hormone-binding globulin Studies of a hexanic extract of S. repens suggests it decreases prostaglandin and leukotriene production to inhibit the arachidonic acid cascade and decreases B lymphocyte infiltrates and interleukin (IL)-1b and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a levels to adjust inflammatory status and gene expression . In animal models of prostate hyperplasia, it demonstrated a global anti-inflammatory effect on hyperplastic prostates with lobe-specific anti-androgenic effects . In human prostate and vascular cells in an inflammatory environment, it also decreases monocyte chemotactic protein-1 production and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 expression . In human prostate carcinoma cells, inhibitory effects on cell growth were attributed to downregulation of inflammatory-related genes and activation of nuclear factor-kappa B pathway A chalcanonol glycoside from the seeds of saw palmetto as well as sterolic derivatives have demonstrated antiproliferative effects ",

      "How It Works": "Schisandra is a fruit extract used in traditional Chinese medicine.\nScientists do not know how Schisandra works, but laboratory experiments have begun to identify some of its biological activities. Schisandra has antioxidant activity, which means that it neutralizes free radicals that can cause cellular and genetic damage. When tested in animals, schisandra had the following effects: 1) protection of the liver and nervous system, 2) improved mental and physical functioning, 3) antidiabetic effects, and 4) reversal of resistance to chemotherapy drugs by tumor cells. The small number of studies in humans is too limited to draw any conclusions.",
      "Purported Uses": [

      "Special Point": "Schisandra can reduce the levels of certain liver enzymes on lab tests.",
      "Scientific Name": "Schisandra chinensis, Schisandra sphenanthera",
      "Clinical Summary": "Schisandra is derived from the fruit of the plant and is used in traditional Chinese medicine for coughs and wheezing , various liver diseases , stomach disorders , spontaneous sweating , and as an adaptogen . In vitro studies have shown that schisandra has anti-inflammatory  and anticancer  properties, and protects against adriamycin-induced cardiotoxicity . In animal models, schisandra protects the liver against various toxins , has beneficial effects after myocardial infarction , enhances endurance and metabolism , improves cognitive functioning , and exhibits antimicrobial , antioxidant, neuroprotective , and anti-hyperglycemic activity . Active lignans isolated from schisandra, particularly schisandrin A, were found to reverse P-glycoprotein (Pgp)-mediated multidrug resistance of various cancer cell lines to doxorubicin, vincristine, and paclitaxel Very few human trials have been performed with this supplement. Two small clinical trials suggest improvements in subjects with fatty liver disease using a mixture of schisandra fruit extract and sesamin, a lignan marketed as a fat-reduction supplement , and possible benefit for those with chronic hepatitis C virus when used in combination with other oral antioxidants . Another small trial of a proprietary herbal combination that included schisandra suggests improved performance of cognitive tasks . Schisandra was also found to reduce tacrolimus-associated side-effects of diarrhea and agitation and to improve liver function in liver transplant patients . Additional research is necessary to determine actual efficacy attributable to schisandra and to uncover possible interactions or side effects associated with this supplement.",
      "Purported Uses2": [
        "Asthma",
        "Cough",
        "Diarrhea",
        "Indigestion",
        "Liver disease",
        "Strength and stamina",
        "Sweating"
      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "Lignans in schisandra have been linked to various effects including hepatoprotective , antiproliferative, and estrogenic activities . In vitro, schisantherins downregulated pro-inflammatory cytokines and mediators by blocking NF-κB and MAPK signaling . In animal toxicity models, pretreatment with schisandra lignans increased DT-diaphorase activity associated with enhanced menadione elimination , and provided hepatoprotection and improved Phase I metabolism 24 h after carbon tetrachloride exposure . Other animal studies suggest that schisandra increases hepatic glutathione levels and glucose-6-phosphate and glutathione reductase activities . It also inhibits α-glucosidase activity, thereby lowering postprandial blood glucose levels , and can improve cardiac function after ischemic injury by downregulating inflammatory cytokines, activating the eNOS pathway, inhibiting apoptosis, and enhancing cell proliferation . In amyloid-beta-induced memory impairment, schisandra increased superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activities and glutathione levels in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of mice while decreasing malondialdehyde and oxidized glutathione . It also enhanced endurance and metabolism in the skeletal muscle of exercised rats by upregulating PGC-1α expression α-iso-cubebenol in schisandra inhibited iNOS and COX-2 expression in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated macrophages  and reversed septic shock by triggering protective downstream signaling pathways in a mouse sepsis model .The anthocyanin cyanidin-3-O-xylosylrutinoside (Cya-3-O-xylrut) has been identified as responsible for its antioxidant activity In human renal cell carcinoma cells, a schisandra polysaccharide identified as SCP induced apoptosis via caspase-3 and -9 activation, increased PARP cleavage, and inactivation of the ERK pathway . Another polysaccharide known as SCPP11 exhibited antitumor effects in hepatic cancer models via increased thymus index as well as serum IL-2 and TNF-alpha levels, and enhanced phagocytosis and NO production . Pgp-mediated chemotherapy drug-resistance in various cancer cell lines was reversed by schisandrins through the inhibition of Pgp and total protein kinase C function/expression Schisandra coadministration increases oral bioavailability of tacrolimus via inhibition of Pgp-mediated efflux and cytochrome P450 3A-mediated metabolism, and reduction of intestinal first-pass effect ",
      "Adverse Reactions": "No serious side effects have been reported, although schisandra is not well studied in humans. A few minor adverse events, such as sleepiness and cold extremities, were observed in both treatment and placebo groups in one small trial ",

In Cuba where these products originated, the government rejected the use of Escozul in 2009 because there was not enough data. The homeopathic version which uses very dilute solutions of the active ingredient, has not been shown to treat or prevent cancer. The properties of blue scorpion venom are just starting to be described more thoroughly in scientific research. Therefore, like venoms from other scorpion species, blue scorpion venom compounds one day may be isolated and properly developed to create cancer therapies, but much more research is needed.",

      "Patient Warnings": "Scorpion venom products marketed to cancer patients including Escozine and Vidatox have not been studied in clinical trials. There is no evidence for their use to prevent or treat cancer in humans, and they have not been reviewed or approved by the FDA.",
      "Side Effects": "The venoms marketed to cancer patients are untested and unregulated. Therefore side effects are currently unknown.",
      "Brand Name": "Escozul®, Vidatox®, Escozine®",
      "Scientific Name": "Rhopalurus junceus; other species include Mesobuthus martensii (Buthus martensii), Tityus cambridgei, Odontobuthus doriae, Tityus discrepans, Mesobuthus eupeus, Leiurus quinquestriatus, and Androctonus crassicauda",
      "Clinical Summary": "The scorpion is a predatory arthropod represented by more than 1500 different species worldwide . As part of the diverse arachnid class, scorpions possess a venomous stinger at the end of their tails used to paralyze prey or for self-defense. Although the venom is generally considered poisonous, there are varying degrees of pathogenicity and only a small fraction of scorpion species are deadly to humans The belief that scorpions have medicinal properties has existed for centuries, and many instances of their use have been recorded in both indigenous and folk medicine. In Traditional Chinese Medicine, the entire scorpion of the Buthus martensii Karsch (BmK) species is used to treat convulsions, spasms, and pain , and some laboratory studies confirm that scorpion venoms do contain antinociceptive properties Scorpion venom has also been evaluated for other applications. It appears useful in killing intraerythrocytic malarial pathogens without harming the erythrocyte , and some species contain antimicrobial peptides that appear effective against yeast, fungi, bacteria, and viruses . Scorpion venom could also be a source for the isolation of anticancer molecules. Preliminary assessments indicate that Tityus discrepansAndroctonus crassicauda, and Odontobuthus doriae venoms are effective inducers of apoptosis in breast cancer cell lines  . A component in BmK venom inhibits proliferation of human leukemia cells suggesting therapeutic potential in hematopoietic malignancies . Because the general composition and expression level of scorpion venom depends on genetic variations and geographical environments, research to identify the active components that have therapeutic potential across the various species continues Rhopalurus junceus, or blue scorpion venom, originated from Cuba, and is often marketed as having anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and analgesic properties. Claims for these products, known as Escozine and Escozul, are largely based on anecdotal information, testimonials, and preclinical experiments on laboratory animals. However, the manufacturers’ research cannot be corroborated and has not been published in any peer-reviewed journal . In 2009, the Cuban government formally rejected the use of Escozul due to insufficient clinical data . Only recently has there been a functional characterization of R. junceus in the literature, but without any clinical evidence presented for R. junceus-derived products . A homeopathic version, Vidatox, has since been developed and has also not been evaluated in peer-reviewed journals.The more likely scenario for future benefits with scorpion venom in cancer therapy may come from clinical trials involving chlorotoxin (CTX), a scorpion venom-derived peptide. CTX may facilitate the entry of chemotherapeutic compounds into tumor cells to target drug delivery and improve efficacy . In addition, it holds the potential for reducing side effects and can be synthesized in the laboratory . A synthetic CTX that selectively binds to glioma and other tumors cells is being evaluated as a radiopharmaceutical to deliver therapeutic levels of radiation directly to disease sites . A CTX/near-infrared fluorescent molecule combination is under investigation as a cancer imaging agent, a kind of “tumor paint” that may help surgeons more clearly identify tumor margins and micrometastases, and spare normal tissue Continued research on the complex characteristics of scorpion venom among the various species is needed to both isolate the properties of therapeutic importance and develop their application in cancer research.",

      "Mechanism of Action": "The sheer number of compounds and their diverse pharmacologic properties among different scorpion species leaves their mechanisms poorly understood . Most scorpion venoms are known to contain peptide toxins that mainly act on ion channels . These biologically active peptides are classified as either disulfide-bridged peptides (DBPs) which are mostly responsible for neurotoxic effects, and non-disulfide-bridged (NDBPs) which have been an attractive area of research for their spectrum of biological activities Hp1036 and Hp1239 peptides are antiviral and exert inhibitory effects throughout the Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) life cycle . TsAP-1 and TsAP-2 peptides possess antimicrobial and anticancer activity that can be substantially improved with increased cationicity . AcrAP1 and AcrAP2 analogues have also displayed enhanced antimicrobial activity and unlike the native peptides, also displayed growth modulation effects on a range of human cancer cell lines . Peptides are also being engineerd to produce selective therapeutic ion channel inhibitors which may have potential in the treatment of autoimmune diseases . A fusion protein generated from chlorotoxin inhibited matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2) release from pancreatic cancer cells, which require their activation during invasion and migration The venom from R. junceus was shown to have reversible beta and alpha activities. It enabled sodium channels to open at more negative potentials, delayed inactivation of potassium channels, and rapidly blocked ERG potassium channels in neuroblastoma cells . Proteins found in T. discrepans venom bind to FasL and Bcl-2 on the surface of breast cancer cells inducing apoptosis Buthus matensii Karsch (BmK) scorpion venom extracts inhibited human breast cancer cells by inducing apoptosis and blocking cell cycle in G0/G1 phase BmK venom also induces apoptosis in human lymphoma cells by upregulating PTEN, and decreases levels of Akt and Bad phosphorylation, resulting in increased p27 expression . Another component of BmK venom inhibits cell proliferation by modulating NF-κB activation in human leukemia cells . Bengalin, a high molecular weight protein from the Indian black scorpion induced autophagy in human leukemic cells through ERK-MAPK pathway A. crassicauda and O. doriae venoms induce apoptosis via caspase-3 activity and nuclear DNA fragmentation in neuroblastoma and breast cancer cells . Further, the proteolytic enzymes in scorpion venom are likely responsible for its necrotic activity Leiurus quinquestriatus venom contains a chlorotoxin (CTX) associated with MMP2 that increases its affinity for primary brain tumors and reduces the potential for tumor invasion of healthy tissue . CTX, which functions as a paralytic in nature, has a molecular structure with a single tyrosine residue available for radioiodination . Synthetic CTX has shown antiangiogenic properties and a synergistic effect with bevacizumab in animal models  and specifically binds with the protein annexin A2 in diverse tumor cell lines An array of other components in scorpion venoms may have therapeutic uses. BmK venom has sympathomimetic and analgesic properties . It contains a peptide that modulates G-protein-coupled receptor activity, and has a primary structure similar to enkephalin-like peptides . Other venoms also exhibit antinociceptive properties which appear to be activated by an endogenous opioid system partly triggered by counterirritation ",
      "Adverse Reactions": "The venoms marketed to cancer patients currently remain untested and unregulated. A lack of documentation on side effects does not preclude the potential for adverse events.Adverse events with respect to isolated substances being developed for clinical studies are also yet to be determined.",
      "Herb-Drug Interactions": "Anticonvulsants: Theoretical interaction due to anticonvulsant properties Sympathomimetics: Theoretical interaction due to sympathomimetic properties ",
      "Herb Lab Interactions": "Scorpion venom could potentially alter prothrombin time, partial prothrombin time, and international normalized ratio values due to presence of phospholipase A2 ",

However, there are some compounds in this herb that may have opposite effects. Additional studies are needed to confirm the circumstances under which this herb may be beneficial.S. baicalensis extracts also reduce inflammation, act as antioxidants, and kill gram-positive bacteria in the laboratory setting.

Its ability to attenuate asthma is attributed to reduced airway injury and restored mitochondrial function . The neuroprotective effects of flavonoids were ameliorated by diazepam, a GABA receptor agonist, suggesting that the components influence GABA receptor activity \nIn vitro studies suggest that certain flavonoid components of S. baicalensis have anticancer activity. Induction of apoptosis in hepatoma G2, 3B, and SK-Hep1 cell lines occurs following 48 hours of exposure to baicalein, baicalin, and wogonin at concentrations of 25-100 mcg/ml. Wogonin causes arrest at G1 phase while baicalin and baicalein cause G2/M accumulation . Additional studies show that baicalin, at concentrations of 50-200 mcg/ml, activates caspase-3, resulting in apoptosis of Jurkat cells (leukemia-derived T cells). However, low-dose baicalin upregulated expression of multiple angiogenic genes to increase cell proliferation in developing blood vessels, while high-dose baicalin inihbited angiognesis by inducing cell death, suggesting dose-dependent dual effects; the compound baicalein exhibited only inhibitory effects ",

      "Clinical Summary": "Scutellaria barbata is a perennial herb prevalent in Korea and southern China. It is used along with other herbs in traditional Chinese medicine to treat bacterial infections, hepatitis, and tumors, and is also used as a diuretic. It should not be confused with Scutellaria baicalensisData from in vitro studies suggest that S. barbata has antibacterial , antioxidant , antimutagenic , and anticancer  properties. A number of constituents including flavonoids are thought to be responsible for its anticancer activity. Animal models have demonstrated antitumor activity with S. barbata across a range of cancers . However, different extraction methodologies and/or plant origins have yielded varying degrees of antitumor effects A large long-term population study identifies S. barbata among the single herbs used in TCM that may reduce risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in hepatitis B patients . Small studies also suggest it is safe and may benefit patients with advanced breast cancer . Further research is needed to confirm these effects.",

        "Hepatitis"
      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "S. barbata possesses a range of antitumor activities via multiple intracellular targets , with major anticancer constituents identified as scutellarin, apigenin5-O-β-glucopyranoside and apigenin along with p-coumaric acid, luteolin and 4’-hydroxywogonin . Polysaccharides in S. barbata demonstrate antioxidant and free radical-scavenging activity . Flavonoids and scutebarbatines can regulate immune function, with decreases in IL-17, IL-10, FOXP3, TGF-beta1, RORgammat, and IL-6 levels, and increases in IL-2 and IFN-gamma levels . Neo-clerodane diterpenoids also have demonstrated anticancer  and antiviral  activities.In vitro and in vivo studies of S. barbata  have focused mostly on colon, lung, and liver cancer models. In human colon cancer cells, S. barbata induces apoptosis and inhibits cell proliferation and tumor angiogenesis via modulation of Hedgehog, Akt, and p53 pathways, upregulation of proapoptotic Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, decreased cyclin D1 and CDK4 expression, G1/S cell cycle arrest, vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) inhibition, and promotion of p21 expression In lung tumor models, S. barbata inhibits hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) alpha and VEGF expression . Polysaccharides in S. barbata inhibit proliferation and downregulate phospho-c-Met expression and downstream phospho-Erk and phospho-Akt signaling . The alkaloid scutebarbatine A demonstrates mitochondria-mediated apoptotic effects via upregulation of cytochrome c, caspase-3, and caspase-9, and downregulation Bcl-2 levels In liver tumors, S. barbata flavonoids suppressed angiogenesis via VEGF regulation, inhibition of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) and MMP9 expression at both mRNA and protein levels, and simultaneous increases in tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases 1 (TIMP1) and TIMP2 expression . Total flavonoids induced significant increases in DNA fragmentation and upregulation of Smac, Apaf-1, cytochrome c, caspase-9, and caspase-3 suggesting mitochondrial pathway-induced apoptosis . A crude extract of S. barbata inhibited liver tumorigenesis and relieved hepatic injury by significantly reducing markers of oxidative stress while increasing superoxide dismutase levels S. barbata was also shown to prevent diosbulbin B-induced liver injury by attenuating NF-kappaB-mediated hepatic inflammation and ameliorating liver oxidative stress injury, while promoting antitumor activity S. barbata flavonoids have produced synergistic effects in combination with cisplatin in ovarian cancer cells A propriety aqueous extract of S. barbata used in a few small studies appears to target tumor mitochondria to induce ROS generation and severe DNA damage followed by PARP hyperactivation, cellular ATP and NAD depletion, and glycolysis inhibition ",

      "Mechanism of Action": "Miraculin is a glycosylated protein  that acts on the human sweet taste receptor of the tongue (hT1R2, hT1R3). It binds only in acidic conditions, which allows conversion of sour stimuli to sweet . The effects last 1 to 2 hours, although the intensity declines with time . Miraculin alters taste in primates but not in rodents . Maximum taste-modifying activity is observed at pH 3.0, which allows two key histidine residues to facilitate cooperative binding, dimerization and miraculin-to-receptor binding in an acidic environment . Only the dimeric and tetrameric forms of miraculin are active . In a weakly acidic environment, miraculin acts as a positive allosteric modulator; at neutral pH, it acts as an antagonist that can inhibit the activity of other sweeteners including sucrose, saccharine and aspartame . Results from another study suggest that miraculin binds hT1R2-hT1R3 as an antagonist at neutral pH and changes into an agonist at acidic pH Compounds isolated from the stem of S.dulcificum inhibit the proliferation of A375.S2 human melanoma cells via free-radical scavenging activity and by inhibiting tyrosinase ",

The flowers of Spilanthes have earned it the name “toothache plant” for their numbing and pain-relieving effects. Spilanthes has also been noted to stimulate taste and improve saliva flow. Therefore, whether it could help side effects from cancer treatments such as dry mouth, mouth sores and inflammation, or changes in taste sensations, may be of interest to researchers. However, very few studies have been conducted and none of them have yet been done in humans.",

      "Special Point": "Spilanthes, an herbaceous plant that grows in tropic and subtropic regions, should not be confused with jambu madu or wax jambu, which are names for the wax apple fruit tree that is widely cultivated in Southeast Asia. ",
      "Scientific Name": "Spilanthes acmella, Spilanthes oleracea, Acmella oleracea, Acmella uliginosa",
      "Clinical Summary": "Spilanthes acmella is an herbaceous plant that belongs to the family Asteraceae. It is well-known in traditional systems of medicine throughout Asia and South America, where it is known as Jambu. The leaves are used for culinary purposes, and the flowers have been used for their numbing and pain-relieving properties, earning the plant such common names as the toothache plant. It has also been noted to relieve stomatitis, have taste-activating properties, and to induce a salivary response. Spilanthes is used to help relieve side effects from cancer treatments such as dry mouth, gum irritation, loss or changes in taste sensation, and to stimulate appetite.Spilanthol and acmellonate, compounds derived from this plant, are associated with reduced toothache pain and increased saliva secretion . In vitro and in vivo studies of S. acmella confirm antimalarial , antimicrobial, antifungal , and taste-activating  properties. Animal models suggest aphrodisiac , anti-inflammatory , diuretic , anesthetic, and antipyretic  activities. Acmella uliginosa has demonstrated antinociceptive , antifungal, antibacterial, and antioxidant activities . Compounds from A. oleracea have also suggested antinociceptive , gastroprotective , insecticidal , and acaricidal  effects.In vitro, a hydroethanolic extract of S. acmella produced cytotoxic effects in tumor cell cytoskeletons . However, human data are lacking.",

      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "Antinociceptive effects of the various plant species have been attributed to their anti-inflammatory properties  and engagement of opioid receptors . Compounds that induce the tingling sensation associated with topical application or chewing of jambu include spilanthol, and to a lesser degree acmellonate . Taste-activating alkamide compounds that induce a salivary response have also been identified . Spilanthol is among the most active alkamides isolated from aerial parts of A. oleracea to demonstrate insecticidal  and acaricidal  activity. It was also found to significantly inhibit cytochrome P4502E1, but the physiological significance of this inhibition is not clear In animal models, spilanthol isolated from S. acmella reduced inflammatory responses via nuclear factor kappa-B inactivation . Potential mechanisms for gastroprotective effects with rhamnogalacturonan, a polysaccharide isolated from A. oleracea, include protectively binding to the mucosal surface, increasing mucus synthesis, scavenging radicals, and diminishing secretions of acid and pepsin . Other research suggests that rhamnogalacturonan promotes the restoration of epithelial continuity via epithelial cell proliferation and enhances mucin production to promote gastric ulcer healing An animal study found that an S. acmella ethanolic flower extract, rich in alkylamides, affected male sexual functioning by increasing levels of testosterone, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and luteinizing hormone (LH) ",

      "Mechanism of Action": "Squalamine is a cholestane steroid conjugated to a spermidine at position C-3. However, it does not have glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid effects . Squalamine binds to cell membranes and inhibits the specific membrane Na/H exchanger NHE3, causing an alteration in intracellular pH and a disruption of intracellular signaling induced by angiogenic growth factors Squalamine alters the shape and decreases volume of endothelial cells in embryonic vascular beds, causing narrowing of the vessel lumen and occluding blood flow . These actions inhibit multiple key steps in angiogenesis, including mitogen-induced actin polymerization, cell-cell adhesion, and cell migration, ultimately inhibiting endothelial cell proliferation. Squalamine blocks downstream signaling pathways of VEGF, including VEGF-induced phosphorylation of p44/p42 MAP kinase in vascular endothelial cells , disrupts F-actin fibers, and induces internalization of vascular endothelial-cadherin from the membrane into the intracellular compartment . It decreases retinal neovascularization that is thought to benefit macular degeneration Squalamine is an amphipathic compound that interacts with various membrane glycerophospholipids at unique affinities . It has a faster killing rate of gram-positive bacteria than gram-negative bacteria Squalamine enhances the cytotoxicity of chemotherapy drugs  by promoting tumor cell apoptosis and by reduced angiogenesis . Its antiangiogenic effects are due to inhibition of endothelial cell proliferation and migration induced by various growth factors ",

      "Scientific Name": "Hypericum perforatum",
      "Clinical Summary": "St. John’s wort is a perennial herb indigenous to Europe, West Asia, and North Africa, and now prevalent in many parts of the world. The flowering tops are reputed for their medicinal properties and the herb has a centuries-long history as a remedy for headaches, kidney problems, and nerve disorders. It was also used by Native Americans for wound healing, snakebites, and diarrhea. Today, St. John’s wort is used in several European countries as an antidepressant, and to treat anxiety, sleep and seasonal affective disorder. It is marketed as a dietary supplement in the U.S. for depression and other psychological symptoms.St. John’s wort is one of the most extensively studied herbs, with active constituents hyperforin and hypericin being the focus of most research. Lab studies show that St. John’s wort has neuroprotective properties  and may relieve neuropathic pain . Clinical studies suggest St. John’s wort may be as effective as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as paroxetine , fluoxetine  and citalopram  for mild to moderate depression; it was also shown to be a cost-effective alternative to generic antidepressants . Reductions in depression were also sustained with continued use . However, data are inconsistent when all types of depression are analyzed  and some randomized trials have found St. John’s wort ineffective for both major  and minor depression . A few studies also indicate efficacy of St. John’s wort in the management of premenstrual syndrome , and vasomotor symptoms in peri- and postmenopausal women , but failed to show any benefit for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents  and in individuals with stomatodynia . Another study suggests that St. John’s wort may enhance the effect of clopidogrel in patients who have undergone percutaneous coronary intervention  but more studies are needed.St. John’s wort has many documented interactions with conventional drugs through the induction of cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes resulting in reduced efficacy or treatment failure, as well as several associated adverse effects. Its use may also cause photosensitivity  and has been associated with increased risk of cataracts . Therefore, patients should speak with their physician or pharmacist before using this product.",

      "Mechanism of Action": "In vitro studies have shown hypericum to inhibit serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine reuptake by neurons . Although earlier data suggested monoamine oxidase inhibition, further investigation demonstrated this inhibition to be insignificant in vivo . More recently hyperforin, the main constituent associated with serotonin reuptake inhibition, was shown to activate transient receptor potential C6 channels in vitro inducing neurite outgrowth and possibly influencing monoamine uptake , and to stimulate the development and function of oligodendrocytes . Hypericin suppresses voltage-dependent calcium channel and mitogen-activated protein kinase activity and evokes glutamate release, adding further clues to its function in the brain . Hypericin-induced phototoxicity appears to be oxygen-dependent and may involve intracellular pH reduction or mediation by the TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand receptor system . Incidental reporting also suggests that photoactivated hypericin can cause the demyelination of cutaneous axons Mechanisms by which St. John’s wort induces or modulates different enzymes, altering the pharmacokinetics of corresponding drug substrates, continue to be evaluated. Hyperforin induces CYP 3A4 through activation of the pregnane X receptor  and St. John’s wort extract modulates UDP-glucuronosyltransferase  and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) activity via protein kinase C (PKC) . Analgesic and CNS activity may be due to its bioflavonoid content  as well as through inhibition of PKC isoforms and their phosphorylation The enolized beta-dicarbonyl system contained in hyperforin may play a central role in its antiangiogenic activity, but the chemical and metabolic instability of hyperforin itself has led to the search for more stable derivatives . In animal models, hyperforin and its stabilized derivative aristoforin suppress lymphatic endothelial cell growth and lymphangiogenesis by inducing cell cycle arrest or apoptosis . Hyperforin also reversed P-gp and breast cancer resistance protein activity in human myeloid leukemia cell lines ",

      "Adverse Reactions": "Common: Headache, nausea, dry mouth, sleepiness, and gastrointestinal upset Infrequent: Photosensitivity , neuropathy , increased prothrombin time Case reportsAcute transplant rejection: Two patients with prior heart transplantation due to end-stage ischemic cardiomyopathy who were maintained on immunosuppressive regimens that included cyclosporin experienced transplant rejection directly linked to the use of St. John’s wort. After discontinuation of the supplement, plasma cyclosporin returned to therapeutic values . A subsequent report of 45 kidney or liver transplant recipients also describe rejection episodes or declines in trough levels of cyclosporin (average, 49%) linked to ingestion of St. John’s wort. In many cases, these patients did not inform their healthcare team about their ingestion of this supplement Cardiovascular collapse: Hypotension without anaphylactic symptoms occurred shortly after induction of general anesthesia was potentially linked to long-term use of St. John’s wort in a patient Severe drug-induced acute hepatitis: A 61-year-old woman with chronic hepatitis C receiving pegylated interferon α obtained undetectable qualitative hepatitis C virus that persisted after treatment suspension. The patient revealed use of St. John’s wort for depressed mood in the preceding 6 weeks. She was hospitalized after continued worsening of liver function tests and tested positive for antinuclear antibodies. Elevated levels slowly declined after methylprednisolone treatment, but a new flare occurred with steroid tapering. Liver function tests returned to baseline levels after 6 months of prednisone treatment. It was determined the combination of pegylated interferon α and St. John’s wort resulted in severe acute hepatitis in this patient Mania: Occurred in 3 patients with underlying bipolar disorder but resolved promptly in 2 patients following discontinuation while the third experienced persistent agitation for several months Serotonin syndrome: Hypertension, diaphoresis, agitation, dizziness, and weakness with acute onset occurred in 1 patient following 10 days of St. John’s wort, but resolved following supportive care and supplement discontinuation . In a case series, five elderly patients who combined prescription antidepressants with St. John’s wort were clinically diagnosed with central serotonergic syndrome Erythroderma: Developed 4 days after initiation of St. John’s wort affecting both light-exposed and non light-exposed areas of skin, and resolved after 5 weeks with concomitant oral steroids Hypericin-induced radiation recall dermatitis: A 65-year-old man with completely resected squamous cell carcinoma of the epiglottis who received adjuvant locoregional radiotherapy (RT) developed unusual intensive skin reactions during treatment. The skin was completely bland at follow-up, but half a year later the previously irradiated skin became erythematous. The patient took hypericin for depressive mood during and months after RT without informing the physician. Local application of a steroid cream diminished symptoms that would return after the end of steroid therapy. Symptoms eventually disappeared with the discontinuation of hypericin Photosensitivity reactions: Three cases of photosensitivity reactions occurred in individuals who used topical and/or oral St. John’s wort preparations prior to sun exposure or undergoing phototherapy . Although 2 of the 3 cases were complicated by pre-existing disease and therapy, St. John’s wort photosensitivity was still the identified cause, and in the patient with pre-existing disease did not entirely resolve.Subacute toxic neuropathy: A 35-year-old woman who took St. John’s Wort for mild depression developed stinging pain on sun-exposed areas after 4 weeks which worsened during and after sun exposure. Pain was provoked by light touch or air movement. Symptoms began to improve 3 weeks after St. John’s wort was withdrawn, and disappeared after 2 months Sexual dysfunction: Decreased sexual libido was normalized following discontinuation of St. John’s wort Withdrawal syndrome: Nausea, anorexia, dry retching, dizziness, dry mouth, thirst, cold chills, and extreme fatigue occurred in a patient within 24 hours of stopping intake of St. John’s wort after 32 days of treatment Prolonged facial dystonia: Reported in a 58-year-old Caucasian woman following use of bupropion along with St. John’s wort ",

Some studies have shown that stevia helps lower blood pressure in humans. Other animal and laboratory studies suggest stevia products can suppress inflammation mediators in the body and can help to regulate blood sugar level. However, these effects have not been studied in humans.",

      "Scientific Name": "Stevia rebaudiana",
      "Clinical Summary": "Stevia rebaudiana is an herb native to Brazil and Paraguay. Its raw leaves as well as purified extracts, such as stevioside and its aglycone steviol, have been used as sweeteners and promoted as sugar substitutes for diabetics . Stevia extract is said to be many times sweeter than table sugar .  However, only the purified steviol glycosides have the Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) status by the FDA for use in food In vitro and animal studies indicate that stevia has antitumor , anti-inflammatory , and hepato- and reno-protective effects . Stevia was also shown effective in lowering hypertension and hyperglycemia . In a placebo-controlled trial in patients with hypertension, stevioside usage improved quality of life when compared with placebo . Well-designed trials are warranted.\nStevia may have additive effects with other antihypertensive and antidiabetic medications. Gastrointestinal and neurological side-effects as well as mutagenic activity have been reported ",

        "Diabetes"
      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "The mechanisms underlying the antihypertensive effect of stevioside are still unclear, although it is believed to act as a calcium channel antagonist, similar to the drug verapamil . It may also have antitumor properties, as evidenced by its inhibition of the tumor-promoting 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) in mouse skin . In vitro studies have shown that stevioside suppresses the production of inflammatory mediators . Stevia products have been shown to inhibit hepatic gluconeogenesis  and increase insulin sensitivity in animal studies ",
      "Warnings": "At high doses, steviol was shown to exhibit weak mutagenic activity ",
      "Contraindications": "Pregnant women should not consume this herb.",
      "Adverse Reactions": "Case Report: Four patients in a study experienced abdominal fullness, myalgia, nausea, and asthenia following consumption of 500 mg stevioside powder. Their symptoms disappeared after 1 week of treatment ",

      "How It Works": "Sun Farms Vegetable Soup has not been shown to treat or prevent cancer.\nSun Farms Vegetable Soup contains soybeanshiitake mushroom, mung bean, red date, scallion, garlic, lentil bean, leek, hawthorn fruit, onion, American ginsengangelica rootlicorice, dandelion root, senegal root, ginger, olive, sesame seed, and parsley. Scientists are unsure of exactly how it works because only a few laboratory studies have tested it.In mice taking dried Sun Soup powder, tumor growth was slowed by 53–74% compared to mice not taking the powder. Laboratory tests show that Sun Soup contains inositol hexaphosphate (IP6), a compound that slows that formation and growth of cancer cells in laboratory and animals studies. Sun Soup also contains genistein, daidzein, and coumestrol, which are phytoestrogens (also called isoflavones) found in soybeans. In the laboratory, genistein slows the growth of blood vessels that feed tumors, damages the DNA of cancer cell lines, and, along with daidzein and coumestrol, inhibits the growth of prostate cancer cells. Shiitake mushrooms contain lentinan, which may stimulate the immune system. A study in mice found that shiitake extract and mung bean extract slowed the growth of tumors.However, despite all of these anticancer activities in the laboratory setting, it is still not known whether Sun Soup will have an antitumor effect in the human body.",

      "Clinical Summary": "A proprietary product developed by the biochemist, Alexander Sun, Sun Soup contains water, soybeanshiitake mushroom, mung bean, red date, scallion, garlic, lentil bean, leek, hawthorn fruit, onion, American ginsengangelica rootlicorice, dandelion root, senegal root, ginger, olive, sesame seed, and parsley . Patients use it in conjunction with conventional therapies to prevent and treat cancer, HIV/AIDS, promote weight gain, and as an immunostimulant.\nSun Soup exhibits antitumor activity in mouse models . Data from small open-label phase I/II studies of SV administered concurrently with conventional therapies for stage III and IV non-small cell lung cancer suggest improvements in survival, Karnofsky Performance Scale Score, and objective tumor regression . Larger randomized studies are needed to confirm these findings.",

        "Weight maintenance"
      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "The inventor suggests that the antitumor activities of compounds in some constituents act synergistically . Quantitative analysis of freeze-dried powder (DSV) revealed approximately 63 mg inositol hexaphosphate (IP6), 2.6 mg genistein, 4.4 mg daidzein, and 15.5 mg coumestrol per serving . In vitro and animal studies performed with IP6 suggest that it slows the initiation and/or promotion, inhibits proliferation by chelation of metalloproteins, causes G0/G1 arrest, and induces differentiation of various cancer cell lines. In vitro, genistein inhibits angiogenesis, induces DNA damage in cancer cell lines, and, with daidzein and coumestrol, inhibits the growth of human prostate cancer cell lines . Genistein and coumestrol have been shown to induce NADPH:quinone reductase (QR), a detoxifying phase II enzyme, in colonic cells, leading to possible antitumor effects Shiitake mushrooms contain lentinan, a polysaccharide, which may act as an immunomodulator and enhance production of IL-1, TNF, LAK activity, cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and cytotoxic peritoneal exudate cells. A mouse tumor model showed that mice fed shiitake extract, mung bean extract, or both exhibited tumor inhibition of 60%, 53%, and 82%, respectively, as compared to the control group after 22 days.",
      "Adverse Reactions": "Common: GI fullness or bloatedness after ingestion ",

However, animal studies have shown that oral administration of a standardized SOD extract combined with wheat gliadin may protect against oxidative stress-induced cell death  and stress-induced impairment of cognitive function . There is no supporting literature on the benefits of sublingual SOD.\nThe parenteral formulation, Orgotein, is classified by the FDA as an orphan drug, not as a dietary supplement, for the treatment of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

It has been promoted as a natural immune enhancer. While the exact properties of this product are unclear, certain ingredients may not be appropriate for cancer patients. Aloe vera contains anthraquinone which may irritate the GI system, leading to stomach upset and diarrhea. Certain seaweed products contain carrageenan and algin. At high doses these substances can impair absorption of oral medications. Many seaweed products have problems with contamination, which may pose a risk for immunocompromised patients. Pau d’arco is a bark that has potential anticoagulant effects due to coumarin content. Pau d’arco is typically prepared in 20% ethyl alcohol, but the final alcohol concentration of this product is not listed . Cranberry is acidic, and while the pH of this product is unknown, high concentrations may cause stomach irritation . No studies have shown the efficacy of this costly product, which is distributed through a multi-tiered marketing scheme.\nIn June 2003, the FDA seized nearly $5.3 millions worth of product from Seasilver USA’s San Diego headquarters . Since then Seasilver has agreed to comply with strict FDA and FTC guidelines regarding marketing of its product ",

      "How It Works": "Selenium has not been shown to treat cancer or heart disease.\nSelenium is an element obtained in the diet from Brazil nuts, seafood, meats, cereals and grains. It is an essential part of the antioxidant enzyme glutathione-peroxidase, which protects cells from damage and DNA from mutations. For this reason, it has been studied for the prevention of diseases that are caused by or aggravated by this type of cellular damage, including cancer, heart disease, and rheumatoid arthritis. Selenium is also necessary for proper function of the immune system, but it is not known whether higher-than-normal levels of selenium can stimulate the immune system. Long-term use of selenium may increase the risk of certain types of cancer.",

      "Clinical Summary": "Selenium, an essential dietary trace mineral, is an important component of antioxidant systems such as glutathione peroxidase  that neutralize and protect against damage caused by free radicals and reactive oxygen species. It also plays an important role in thyroid function. Selenium can be obtained from the diet by consuming whole grains, meats, seafood, poultry and nuts. It is also marketed as a supplement to boost immune function and for prevention of cardiovascular, rheumatic diseases, and cancer.\nSeveral studies have been conducted to determine the role of selenium in reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease but data are inconclusive . Selenium supplementation was found to reduce the viral load in individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) . It was also shown to reduce markers of inflammation and oxidative stress in patients with diabetic nephropathy , may improve glucose metabolism, but was not useful in preventing type 2 diabetes and in some cases may increase the risk \nThe importance of selenium in cancer prevention has been documented in epidemiological studies and clinical intervention trials. Data suggest its benefits in preventing gastrointestinal , lung  and bladder cancers . However, the benefits on bladder cancer are not seen in smokers . Selenium supplementation resulted in reduction of side effects including hair loss, abdominal pain, and loss of appetite in ovarian cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy . It was also effective in reducing head and neck lymphedema . It may help to reduce diarrhea associated with radiation therapy in gynecological cancer patients without influencing the effectiveness or long-term survival . Selenium supplementation may decrease chemotherapy-induced fatigue and nausea in adolescents \nHowever, the large prevention study SELECT (Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial) , based on previous data indicating that selenium and vitamin E reduced the incidence of prostate cancer, did not find evidence of protective effects of selenium. The trial was suspended in January 2009, when initial data analysis showed no reduction in the risk of prostate cancer with selenium alone or with vitamin E . Another study showed selenium, when used together with soy and Vitamin E, did not prevent prostate cancer progression . Moreover, results from a cross-sectional analysis of men with prostate cancer indicate that selenium levels may influence the risk of aggressive prostate cancer . Another study shows selenium supplementation may increase prostate cancer mortality . Dietary selenium intake is not associated with thyroid cancer incidence  Further, a review of randomized controlled trials did not find any evidence of selenium’s cancer preventive potential \nA chemoprevention trial of selenium in patients with NSCLC (non small-cell lung cancer) was also halted after interim analysis as data did not show any benefit of selenium supplementation; there was an increase in secondary lung cancers in selenium users, although it was statistically insignificant Long-term use of selenium may also increase the risk of certain types of skin cancer ",

      "Mechanism of Action": "Selenium is an essential structural element of the antioxidant enzyme glutathione-peroxidase that converts aggressive oxidation products and intracellular free radicals into less reactive or neutral components . Other biological functions of selenium include regulation of thyroid hormone action and regulation of the reduction status of vitamin C Selenium has been shown to induce a multi-targeted cell death process characterized by induction of unfolded protein response, ER-stress and occurrence of large cytoplasmic vacuoles, in addition to the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) . However, excessive intake of selenium induces hepatic insulin resistance through opposite regulation of (ROS) Recent data show that the effects of dietary selenium on progression of malignant mesothelioma tumors depend on arising cancer cells’ redox metabolism, and the tumors able to convert increased selenium into a stronger reducing capacity actually benefit from increased selenium intake . In another study, selenium supplementation was shown to afford protection against adriamycin-induced cardiac dysfunction via restoring ATP-sensitive potassium channels (KATP) expression ",
      "Adverse Reactions": "Case Report: Oral consumption of 10 g of sodium selenite supplement for treatment of prostate cancer resulted in the death of a 75-year-old man Chronic selenosis (doses greater than 1000 mcg/day): Muscle weakness, fatigue, peripheral neuropathy, dermatitis, nail and hair changes/loss, garlic breath/body odor, irritability, growth retardation, hepatic necrosis.Toxicity: Acute toxicity via selenium poisoning has been reported with either accidental or suicidal ingestion of gun bluing solution or sheep drench.

However, when these extracts were given by mouth (how all over-the-counter shark cartilage supplements are taken), no anti-tumor effect occurred in mice or in humans.

Lentinan, a polysaccharide extracted from shiitake, may help extend the survival of patients with some cancers when used with chemotherapy, but additional studies are needed.\nSome of the medicinal properties of shiitake mushroom are attributed to a sugar molecule named lentinan, on which extensive research has been done. In laboratory tests, lentinan does not kill cancer cells directly, but enhances a number of aspects of the immune system, which may aid in the slowing of tumor growth. Lentinan also kills viruses and microbes directly in laboratory studies. Most studies involving lentinan involve intravenous or intramuscular injections. It is uncertain whether the ingestion of shiitake mushrooms provides similar effects. One clinical trial has shown shiitake extract alone is not an effective treatment for prostate cancer.

      "Clinical Summary": "Shiitake mushroom, native to East Asia, is cultivated worldwide for its purported health benefits. The fresh and dried forms of the mushroom are commonly used in East Asian cooking. It is also valued as an anticancer agent.Lentinan(1,3 beta-D-glucan), a polysaccharide isolated from shiitake is thought to be responsible for the mushroom’s beneficial effects. Although it has been shown to have anticancer effects , lentinan is considered a biological response modifier, rather than having a direct cytotoxic effect on tumor cells . Studies conducted with shiitake extracts in vitro and in animal models reveal immunostimulatory , antiviral , hepatoprotective , antihypercholemic , antiproliferative , cytotoxic , antimutagenic , and anticaries  properties. Latcripin-13 domain isolated from shiitake was shown to exhibit antitumor activity in lung cancer cells In a randomized dietary intervention in young adults, eating shiitake mushrooms for 4 weeks altered immune function . An orally administered shiitake mycelial extract decreased the incidence of chemotherapy-associated adverse effects in a small study of patients with advanced gastrointestinal cancer , and in combination with immunotherapy, improved QOL in cancer patients . But a polysaccharide/oligosaccharide complex from shiitake extract failed to show effectiveness in the treatment of prostate cancer . More well-designed studies are needed to establish shiitake as a useful adjunct to cancer treatment.",

      "Mechanism of Action": "Shiitake mushroom supplementation enhanced gut immunity by upregulating interleukin (IL)-23 secretion in a murine model of acute dextran sodium sulfate-colitis . Shiitake extracts and the polysaccharide lentinan exerted antiviral effects, by acting on initial replication processes of poliovirus type 1 (PV-1) and bovine herpes virus type 1 (BoHV-1) . Another polysaccharide isolated from shiitake exhibited antibacterial effects in mice by increasing T-helper (Th1) cell immunity, resulting in activation of macrophage-mediated immune response . The isolated protein lentin exhibited antifungal properties, inhibited proliferation of leukemic cells, and suppressed activity of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase . Shiitake consumption in adults altered immune function via increased proliferation of gamma delta-T and NK-T cells, increased secretory immunoglobulin A in saliva, increased IL-1alpha, IL-4, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α levels, and decreased macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha/chemokine C-C ligand 3 (MIP-1alpha/CCL3) levels . A low-molecular-weight lignin from shiitake inhibits hepatitis C virus by binding to viral apolipoprotein E (apoE) before interacting with cell surface heparan sulfate Eritadenine from shiitake may exert antihypercholemic effects and regulate lipid metabolism by inhibiting S-adenosyl homocysteine hydrolase activity, and both eritadenine and shiitake mushroom supplementation upregulated CYP7A1 mRNA expression which was decreased in hypercholesterolemic mice . High doses of shiitake mushroom prevented obesity in rats by increasing plasma triacylglycerol accumulation in the liver Dried shiitake extract caused apoptosis in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells by mediating caspase-3 and -8 pathways  . Inhibition of lung cancer cells by the Latcripin-13 domain isolated from shiitake was shown to be due to apoptotic induction . Anticancer effects of the polysaccharide lentinan (1,3 beta-D-glucan) may be due to its ability to suppress cytochrome P450 1A enzymes that are known to metabolize procarcinogens to active forms . Polysaccharides SLNT1 and JLNT1 isolated from the mushroom also demonstrated antitumor effects by increasing serum IL-2 levels and TNF-α production, and by inducing apoptosis in tumor cells in mice ",

    "details": {
      "How It Works": "Because limited research has been performed on sho-saiko-to, it should be used only under the supervision of a doctor. It may have liver-protective effects. There is no evidence that it can treat or prevent any other type of cancer.\nSho-saiko-to appears to prevent liver injury and stimulate the immune system in laboratory and animal studies. Sho-saiko-to and its components may reduce or stop the spread of liver cancer cells, but have little effect on normal human white blood cells. This could be an advantage because most chemotherapy drugs kill healthy human blood cells as well as tumor cells. Sho-saiko-to also appears to promote liver regeneration and prevent development of precancerous liver growths. Other laboratory tests show that sho-saiko-to can also affect other cancers, but it is not known whether these effects occur in the human body. However, it has been documented that people who use ginseng, one of the herbs found in sho-saiko-to, have a lower risk of liver cancer.",
      "Purported Uses": [
        [
          "To prevent and treat cancer",
          "One clinical trial showed that sho-saiko-to was associated with a decreased risk of developing liver cancer in patients with cirrhosis. Clinical trials are now being performed to determine whether sho-saiko-to can increase survival in patients with liver cancer."

      "Clinical Summary": "Sho-saiko-to or “Xiao Chai Hu Tang” is a Chinese botanical formulation widely known by its Japanese name. It is a mixture of 7 botanicals: Bupleurum root (Chai hu), Pinellia tuber (Ban xia), Scutellaria root (Huang qin), Ginseng (Ren shen), Jujube (da zao), Licorice (Gan cao), and Ginger (Sheng jiang) . Sho-saiko-to is used to treat fever, malaria, gastrointestinal disorders and chronic liver diseases. A prescription form has been used extensively in Japan, predominantly for hepatitis Sho-saiko-to and its components demonstrate marked antiproliferative effects on hepatoma cell lines and ovarian cancer cell lines . Morphological analysis of cells grown in the presence of Sho-saiko-to show evidence of apoptosis . Sho-saiko-to has been shown to prevent liver injury and promote liver regeneration in animal models  and to enhance various aspects of immune function, including effects on killer cells , interleukins , interferon  and macrophages . Data also indicate that Sho-saiko-to causes enhancement of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor . A clinical study shows Sho-saiko-to may improve liver pathology in hepatitis C patients who do not respond to interferon-based treatment Although Sho-saiko-to has a good safety profile, its use is associated with interstitial pneumonitis , liver injuries , and hepatitis . It should only be used under the supervision of a qualified practitioner.",
      "Food Sources": "Some of the ingredients, such as jujube, ginger and licorice, are commonly found in Asian recipes.",
      "Purported Uses2": [
        "Cancer prevention",
        "Cancer treatment",
        "Fever",
        "GI disorders",
        "Infections",
        "Liver disease",
        "Malaria"
      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "Sho-saiko-to (SST) appears to have multifactorial activity, inhibiting proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, preventing liver injury, promoting liver regeneration and enhancing immune function.Human studies show reduced incidence of HCC in users of ginseng, one of the botanicals in this formula . SST and its isolated chemical components demonstrate marked antiproliferative effects on hepatoma lines in vitro. Of particular interest is that SST shows only minimal inhibitory effects on normal human peripheral lymphocytes, even at high concentrations. Morphological analysis of cells grown in the presence of SST shows evidence of apoptosis SST prevents liver injury and promotes liver regeneration in animal models: rats treated with SST show less fibrosis as indicated by reduced liver hydroxyproline and a smaller increase in serum hyaluronic acid. Moreover, these rats develop fewer preneoplastic lesions . SST has also been shown to prevent development or metastasis of carcinomas other than HCC . SST enhances various aspects of immune function including effects on interleukins , interferon , macrophages  and killer cells . Data also indicate that SST causes enhancement of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor . A recent study showed that SST regulates temporal gene expression in SST-treated mouse hepatocytes by way of microRNA ",
      "Warnings": "Sho-saiko-to may cause interstitial pneumonitis, a potentially fatal condition. Concurrent use of interferon may increase this risk.",
      "Contraindications": "Women who are nursing or pregnant and patients currently undergoing interferon treatment should not take Sho-saiko-to.",
      "Adverse Reactions": "Sho-saiko-to-related pneumonitis has been reported in 74 patients (approximately 1 in 20,000) \nLiver injuries and hepatitis have been associated with the use of Sho-saiko-to ",
      "Herb-Drug Interactions": "Interferon: Concurrent use may increase the risk of interstitial pneumonitis Drugs metabolized by Cytochrome P450 enzymes: Sho-saiko-to upregulated expression of CYP2B, CYP3A1 and CYP4A1 and can alter the plasma concentration of these drugs . Sho-saiko-to also interacts with drugs metabolized by CYP3A4, CYP2C9 and CYP1A2 enzymes Tolbutamide: Sho-saiko-to reduces the bioavailability following concurrent oral administration ",
      "Herb Lab Interactions": "Sho-saiko-to may alter aspartate transaminase/alanine transaminase (AST/ALT) ratios.",

      "Mechanism of Action": "In vitro studies indicate that eleuthero contains chemicals that bind to estrogen, progestin, mineralocorticoid, and glucocorticoid receptors . In macrophages, a Siberian ginseng extract suppressed LPS-induced iNOS expression and thus nitric oxide production by possibly inhibiting nuclear factor-kappa B activity  or Akt and JNK signaling , and inhibited reactive oxygen species production Eleutheroside B, eleutheroside E, and isofraxidin — active constituents of Siberian ginseng — showed protective effects against Aβ(25-35)-induced atrophies of axons and dendrites in rat cultured cortical neurons . Isofraxidin also inhibited cell invasion and the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-7 by human hepatoma cell lines HuH-7 and Hep G-2, possibly through the inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation In animal studies, eleuthero root bark was shown to exhibit neuroprotective effects against global cerebral ischemia with recovery of spatial memory in rats, possibly through anti-inflammatory mechanisms of inhibition of COX-2 expression, microglia and astrocyte expression . Eleutherosides restored behavioral and biochemical alterations in mice with sleep deprivation , and alleviated both physical and mental fatigue in mice possibly due to increased fat utilization, delayed accumulation of blood urea nitrogen, and increased lactate dehydrogenase . Eleutherosides also mediate hyperglycemic effects of Siberian ginseng by regulating insulin signaling and glucose utilization In other studies, a Siberian ginseng extract decreased cadmium concentration in the blood and liver of mice as well as cadmium-induced mitotic and apoptotic activity of liver cells . Supplementation with Siberian ginseng reduced LDL cholesterol levels and improved LDL/HDL ratios in postmenopausal women Siberian ginseng extract was shown to moderately inhibit breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP)-mediated methotrexate transport in BCRP-expressing membrane vesicles ",

    "details": {
      "How It Works": "Slippery elm may help to relieve minor cough or sore throat, but there is no clinical evidence to show that it is effective against infections, cancer or other serious medical conditions.\nAlthough little laboratory research has been done with slippery elm per se, scientists are familiar with the effects of the fiber content in this bark extract. Slippery elm products contain mucilage, a sticky mixture of complex sugars that cannot be broken down by the human digestive tract. A formula containing slippery elm improved bowel habits and symptoms in patients with constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome. Mucilage also generally has a soothing effect when applied topically, and relieves cough and sore throat when taken by mouth, but these effects have not been shown specifically for slippery elm.",
      "Purported Uses": [
        [
          "To treat coughs and bronchitis",
          "The mucilage content in slippery elm is thought to relieve coughs and throat irritation, but human data are lacking."

          "The mucilage content in slippery elm is thought to have a soothing effect when applied topically, but human data are lacking."
        ]
      ],
      "Do Not Take If": "You are taking any other medications by mouth at the same time: In theory, the high fiber content of slippery elm can reduce the absorption of other drugs taken at the same time, thereby reducing their effectiveness.",
      "Special Point": "Slippery elm appears to be safe for coughs and minor gastrointestinal complaints, but it should not be used to treat cancer or bronchitis.",
      "Scientific Name": "Ulmus rubra",
      "Clinical Summary": "Slippery elm is a tree native to North America. The bark of the tree is used as herbal medicine to treat gastrointestinal disorders, sore throat, cough, and skin ulcers. Slippery elm is thought to have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. The primary constituent mucilage has demulcent effects. A small clinical trial showed that a formulation containing slippery elm improved the bowel habits and symptoms of constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) Slippery elm is one of the components in Essiac, an herbal formula commonly used as an alternative cancer treatment. However, there is no evidence of antitumor effects in humans.",

        "Skin ulcers",
        "Sore throat"
      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "Mucilage in slippery elm is responsible for its demulcent, emollient, and antitussive properties. Insoluble polysaccharides in mucilage (hexose, pentose, methylpentose) form a viscous material following oral administration or when prepared for topical use. Fiber content is thought to reduce gastrointestinal transit time, act as a bulk forming laxative, and adsorb toxins. Mucosal biopsies from patients with active ulcerative colitis incubated with slippery elm showed a dose-dependent reduction in oxygen free radicals . Another in vitro study also showed antioxidant scavenging activity . The tannin component can act as an astringent . Fatty acid esters such as oleic and palmitic acid are thought to be responsible for antitumor activity , but the specific mechanism remain unclear.",

      "Clinical Summary": "Sophora flavescens is a deciduous shrub related to peas. The root known as “Ku Shen” which means “bitter root” in Chinese, has been used in Traditional Medicine for two thousand years to treat a variety of conditions, including diarrhea, jaundice, skin rashes, and to kill parasites . Although this herb is generally not consumed as a dietary supplement in the West, recent lab studies indicate that it has antitumor properties and patients are using it as a natural cancer treatment.\nMatrine, an alkaloid present in Sophora flavescens, demonstrated antitumor effects against liver , breast , pancreas , myeloma  and gastric  cancer cell lines. Other flavonoids such as kuraninone and sophoraflavonone are thought to be biologically active as well and may have vasodilatory and antiviral effects . However, large-scale clinical studies are needed at confirm these effects in humans.Sophora flavescens acts as a phytoestrogen . Patients with hormone-sensitive cancers should avoid this product.",

      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "In animal models, the antiviral properties of sophoridine, an alkaloid constituent, appear to be mediated via upregulation of IL-10 and IFN-gamma cytokines S. flavescens flavonoids may promote vasodilation by inhibiting Ca influx through a voltage-gated channel . The flavonoids sophoraflavonone G and kurarinone appear to be responsible for antioxidant effects, which are mediated through free-radical scavenging . Anti-inflammatory effects of Sophoraflavonone G are attributed to the inhibition of prostaglandin E2 formation via COX-2 downregulation . (2S)-2’-Methoxykurarinone, a compound isolated from the S. flavescens root, inhibits osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption via receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL)-induced mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and c-Fos-NFATc1 signaling pathways Most of the reported antineoplastic effects of S.flavescens are due to the proapoptotic activity of matrine, the main alkaloid constituent. In human hepatocellular carcinoma cells, matrine inhibits matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) by downregulating the NF-kappa B pathway . It also demonstrates antiangiogenic effects by inhibiting VEGF and VEGFR-2 . Matrine triggers the mitochondrial pathway, in which cytochrome C release induces caspase-9 and -3 activation and subsequently induces apoptosis ",

The beans are rich in protein and other nutrients and are widely consumed as food. Extracts are sold as dietary supplements to treat hot flashes, high cholesterol, and for cancer prevention.Soy contains large amounts of isoflavones that act like estrogen in the body. Studies in animals suggest that soy can prevent or reduce bone loss. In laboratory studies, isoflavones slowed down the growth of several different types of cancer cells, including breast and prostate cancers. Animal studies showed that genistein, one of the isoflavones, may interfere with tamoxifen that is used for breast cancer. But a new study showed that soy foods can benefit women with breast cancer.Patients should consult their physicians about use of soy supplements.",

      "Special Point": "The isoflavone content is minimal in soy sauce or soy oil.",
      "Scientific Name": "Glycine max",
      "Clinical Summary": "Soybeans, derived from Glycine max, are rich in protein and other essential nutrients and are widely consumed as food. Soy also contains significant amounts of isoflavones — genistein (4’,5,7-trihydroxyisoflavone), daidzein (4’,7-dihydroxyisoflavone), and glycitein (4’,7-dihydroxy-6-methoxyisoflavone) . They are marketed as dietary supplements to treat hot flashes, high cholesterol, and for cancer prevention. Isoflavones exhibit both selective estrogen receptor modulator activity and non-hormonal effects. Studies of soy for menopausal symptoms are inconclusive . While some trials indicate slower bone density loss , others report no such effects in postmenopausal women . There may be cardiovascular benefits with soy , as it reduced low-density-lipoprotein (LDL)  and had beneficial effects on blood pressure in hypertensive postmenopausal women  and healthy adults . Genistein improved fasting blood glucose, insulin levels, and insulin resistance . Soy intake also reduced proteinuria in type 2 diabetic patients with nephropathy . However, conflicting data suggest no protective effects against diabetes Other studies of soy did not find benefit for Alzheimer’s disease  or for poorly controlled asthma , but soy isoflavone supplementation alone or with Vitamin D improved some symptoms and quality of life in patients with irritable bowel disease Soy may reduce risk of prostate , lung , and endometrial  cancers, but can increase risk of bladder cancer  and endometrial hyperplasia . It may prolong survival among women with lung cancer , reduce mortality  and breast cancer recurrence regardless of tamoxifen use , or prevent breast cancer . However, long-term soy supplementation did not affect mammographic density in breast cancer patients or high-risk women  and other data suggest adverse effects  or that supplementation may stimulate overexpression of breast cancer genes in patients with invasive breast cancer . Preclinical studies also suggest that soy consumption may increase metastasis , and daidzin-rich extracts may promote ER-positive breast cancer growth Genistein, the most estrogenic isoflavone , demonstrates antiproliferative effects in multiple cell lines, including breast cancer (ER+/-) , prostate cancer (androgen-dependent/-independent) , nasopharyngeal carcinoma , neuroblastoma, sarcoma, and retinoblastoma cells . However, animal studies show that it antagonizes the effects of tamoxifen  and promotes tumor progression in advanced prostate cancer . Soy supplements may decrease serum PSA levels in prostate cancer patients before , but not after , prostatectomy. Further research is needed to evaluate the role of genistein in cancer prevention.Isoflavone supplementation may reduce chemotherapy or radiotherapy side effects , but when used together with vitamin E and selenium, did not prevent prostate cancer progression . It was also ineffective in reducing hot flashes in patients with prostate cancer . Patients should consult their physicians about the use of soy supplements.",
      "Food Sources": "Raw soybeans, low-fat soy flour, roasted soybeans, dry-roasted soy beans, soy milk, tofu, and soy protein isolate. There are no isoflavones in soy sauce or soy oil.",

        "High cholesterol",
        "Menopausal symptoms",
        "Osteoporosis"
      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "Animal studies suggest that genistein and daidzein can prevent or reduce bone loss in a manner similar to synthetic estrogen due to increased beta versus alpha estrogen receptor (ER) binding . Both isoflavones may modulate bone remodeling through ERs by regulating target gene expression . Soy may also contribute to maintaining bone density by causing less calcium to be excreted in the urine Isoflavones may inhibit oxidation of LDL and may alter hepatic metabolism with enhanced removal of LDL and VLDL by hepatocytes . Serum lipids may also be regulated through modified transcription factor and downstream gene expression and by promoting antioxidant enzyme activity Many mechanisms for anticancer effects have been proposed. Genistein affects microRNA expression-targeted translation inhibitors for multiple proteins implicated in regulating various pathobiological processes . It also demonstrated an anti-minichromosome maintenance (MCM) effect, a gene family frequently upregulated in various cancers and considered a promising anticancer drug target In breast cancer, genistein acts as an agonist to estrogen receptor (ER)-alpha in ER-alpha-predominant breast cancer cells, but likely acts as an antiestrogen in cells with ER-beta alone, suggesting therapeutic potential for premenopausal women with ER-alpha-negative/ER-beta-positive tumors . However, genistein also induced estrogen-dependent MCF-7 tumor cell growth and increased breast cancer-associated aromatase expression/activity, suggesting that soy-based supplements may affect aromatase inhibitor efficacy . Genistein is also known to negate tamoxifen’s inhibitory effect on MCF-7 tumor growth and increase expression of estrogen-responsive genes . Alternatively, soy isoflavones may reduce breast cancer risk by decreasing endogenous ovarian steroid levels . Studies suggest that some benefits ascribed to dietary isoflavones may depend on early life exposure, thereby impacting gene expression at an epigenetic level In prostate tumors, soy protein reduced androgen receptor expression . Both genistein and daidzein affect microRNA regulation  and induce decreased methylation of gene promoters including BRCA1 . In tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-resistant prostate cancer cells, soy isoflavones enhance TRAIL-mediated apoptosis by engaging apoptotic pathways and regulating NF-κB activity . However, in a patient-derived prostate cancer xenograft model, increased proliferation and metastasis in genistein-treated groups were linked to enhanced activities of tyrosine kinases, the epidermal growth factor receptor, and its downstream Src . Both genistein and daidzein also act as radiosensitizers for prostate cancer in vitro and in vivo, but pure genistein increased lymph node metastasis, whereas the combination of genistein, daidzein, and glycitein did not. Daidzein may protect against genistein-induced metastasis, and its ability to inhibit cell growth and potentiate radiation appears to be androgen-receptor-independent . In addition, soy isoflavones radiosensitized human A549 NSCLC cells, and decreased hemorrhages, inflammation, and fibrosis caused by radiation suggesting protection of normal lung tissue ",

    "details": {
      "How It Works": "Taurine has been shown to help muscle function and may lower risk of cardiovascular disease.\nTaurine is an amino acid present in many tissues of mammals that plays an important role in heart, muscle, and nervous system functioning. Taurine is obtained through diet by eating meat, dairy, and seafood products, and it can also be made in the body from the amino acid cysteine. Eating foods rich in taurine may lower cardiovascular risk.In animal studies, taurine reduced muscle dysfunction and wasting from disuse, imbalances that prevent the natural detoxification processes, and nerve pain. In humans, taking taurine supplements before exercise reduced muscle damage after high-intensity exercise, but its effect on physical or mental performance has been mixed. It has also been shown that even though taurine levels can be increased in the muscles of rodents through oral supplementation, this does not occur in humans. In overweight and obese adults, taurine reduced inflammation and fat levels in the blood and improved fat and sugar metabolism. However, this has not translated into improvements in blood sugar or insulin response in Type 2 diabetes.Taurine is marketed as a dietary supplement and is also a major ingredient in many energy drinks. There have been some toxic effects noted in animal studies and in humans when taken in excess amounts or with alcohol.",
      "Purported Uses": [
        [
          "Diabetes",
          "Taurine reduced kidney disease caused by diabetes and improved blood sugar levels in lab studies. However, long-term taurine supplementation did not affect insulin response or blood glucose levels in overweight men prone to Type II diabetes."

        [
          "Weight loss",
          "In two small studies, taurine supplementation was shown to reduce weight in healthy overweight and obese individuals, but larger trials are needed."
        ],
        [
          "Neuropathy",
          "Studies done in lab and in animal models indicate that taurine has neuroprotective effects. Human trials have yet to be conducted."
        ]
      ],
      "Patient Warnings": "Excessive taurine intake combined with alcohol and/or caffeine has caused severe adverse effects, including death.",
      "Do Not Take If": [
        "You are taking antihypertensive medications: Taurine may increase the blood-pressure lowering effects of these drugs."
      ],
      "Side Effects": "Case reportsIn these reports, taurine was identified as a major ingredient of energy drinks.Acute kidney failure: In a 17-year-old boy who ingested large quantities of both alcohol and an energy drink containing taurine and caffeine.High pulse rate and death: In a 28-year-old-man after drinking 3 cans of an energy drink containing caffeine and taurine among other ingredients.",
      "Scientific Name": "2-aminoethanesulfonic acid",
      "Clinical Summary": "Taurine is a free amino sulfonic acid present in many tissues of mammals. In the bile, it conjugates with cholesterol to form soluble acids to facilitate excretion. Taurine also plays an important role in the functioning of cardiovascular, skeletal muscle, and nervous systems. Meat, seafood, and dairy products are rich sources, but it can also be synthesized in the body from cysteine . Vegetarians may have a lower level of plasma taurine due to reduced intake of meats . Taurine is marketed as a dietary supplement and is also a major ingredient in many energy drinks.In animal models, chronic taurine intake reversed muscle dysfunction and atrophy  and decreased oxidative stress . Another study showed that maternal taurine ingestion confers a protective effect against developing adult hypertension in the offspring . Taurine also demonstrated neuroprotective effects,  reduced diabetic-induced nephropathy , and improved glycemic control  in vitro and in vivo.In humans, consumption of foods rich in taurine has been associated with lower cardiovascular risk . Ingestion of taurine before exercise improved performance , and a taurine supplement plus branched-chain amino acids reduced muscle damage following high-intensity exercise . However, other studies with energy shots that contained taurine have not found improvements in physical or cognitive performance . Although oral taurine supplementation can increase skeletal muscle of rodents, these results have not been duplicated in humans In overweight adults, taurine helped to reduce triglycerides and improve lipid metabolism . Another study found that taurine supplementation and nutritional counseling increased adiponectin levels and decreased inflammation and lipid peroxidation in obese women . However, long-term supplementation did not affect insulin response or blood glucose levels in overweight men prone to Type 2 diabetes . In prehypertensive patients, taurine significantly decreased blood pressure and improved vascular function . Other small studies suggest taurine supplementation may reduce blood pressure in young borderline hypertensive patients  and benefit older patients with congestive heart failure Co-administration with taurine reduced chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting during maintenance therapy in acute lymphoblastic leukemia Taurine has been associated with some adverse effects in animal models including increases in infection risk , delayed learning and memory  and when coadministered with ethanol, a drastic reduction in blood glucose resulting in death . In humans, some case studies have reported adverse reactions from the excessive ingestion of energy drinks with taurine and caffeine as major ingredients, and in combination with alcohol ",
      "Food Sources": "Meat and seafood, especially dark meat poultry and shellfish; dairy products ",
      "Purported Uses2": [

        "Diabetes",
        "High blood pressure",
        "Neuropathy",
        "Weight loss"
      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "Taurine can be synthesized in the body from cysteine by cysteine sulfinic acid decarboxylase . It circulates in the body in the free form and is not incorporated into proteins. With respect to skeletal muscle, taurine facilitates Ca2+ dependent excitation–contraction processes, contributes to regulation of cellular volume, and assists in providing antioxidant defenses from stress responses . Taurine binds with cholesterol to form bile acid and protects the liver from alcohol-induced steatosis and lipid peroxidation . In animal models of diabetes, it reduced hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia by improving insulin sensitivity and leptin modulation . It also protected the mitochondria of pancreatic islets from malnourishment damage In other studies, taurine showed renoprotective effects by decreasing proinflammatory cytokines and renal oxidative stress , and by inhibiting glucose-induced apoptosis in vascular endothelial cells . Potential prevention of diabetic nephropathy is associated with the inhibition of advanced glycation end products and exerted anti-fibrotic activity Taurine was shown to protect against atherosclerotic disease by reversing endothelial abnormalities . Oral taurine supplementation reduces blood pressure by decreasing the levels of plasma epinephrine  and inhibits ischemia-induced apoptosis in the heart muscle by activating protein kinase Akt activities and suppressing caspase-9 . It upregulates hydrogen sulfide-synthesizing enzyme expression and reduces vascular reactivity via inhibition of transient receptor potential channel subtype 3-mediated calcium influx . Taurine also serves as a neurotransmitter  and crosses the blood-brain barrier by transporters . It reduces glutamate excitotoxicity through regulation of calcium ions and mitochondrial energy metabolism . The anti-apoptotic function of taurine is due to its inhibition of glutamate-induced membrane depolarization ",

      "Scientific Name": "Melaleuca alternifolia",
      "Clinical Summary": "Tea tree oil is an essential oil distilled from the leaves of Melaleuca alternifolia, a plant native to Australia. It has been used in traditional medicine to treat colds, cough and skin infections.The medicinal properties of tea tree oil were first reported in the 1920s. Its antiseptic effects were found to be several folds greater than phenol, a compound that was used extensively at the time to prevent infections. Following this discovery, tea tree oil was incorporated in many topical formulations to treat cutaneous infections and to accelerate wound healing. It is also found as an ingredient in skin and hair products.In vitro studies indicate wide-spectrum antimicrobial , antiviral , antiprotozoal , anti-inflammatory  and antiproliferative  properties. Topical application of tea tree oil was shown to have cytotoxic effects in mice bearing subcutaneous tumors Clinical studies suggest its efficacy in treating acne , tinea pedis , distal subungual onychomycosis , histamine-induced skin inflammation , dandruff , warts , cold sores , recurrent chalazion , and experimental contact dermatitis . A systematic review found that aromatherapy with tea tree oil led to reductions in anxiety and depression scores, improved sleep and resulted in an overall increase in well-being in cancer patients ",
      "Purported Uses2": [

        "Mucositis",
        "Skin infections",
        "Wound healing"
      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "Terpinen-4-ol, a major constituent of tea tree oil, was shown to have antimicrobial activity against Candida albicansEscherichia coliStaphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In addition, terpin-4-ol, alpha-terpineol, and alpha-pinene were found to possess antimicrobial effects against Staphylococcus epidermidis and Propionibacterium acnes. Terpinen-4-ol has also been shown to suppress inflammatory mediator production by activated human monocytes A tea tree oil concentrate prevented influenza virus from entering the host cells by disturbing the normal viral membrane fusion procedure . Other in vitro studies indicate that tea tree oil has weak estrogenic and antiandrogenic properties that may alter the estrogen and androgen signaling pathways . At the same time, the notion that tea tree oil has hormone-modulating properties have been challenged, and further confirmatory research is needed Skin irritation following use of tea tree oil is due to auto-oxidation of tea tree oil, and via formation of epoxide intermediates resulting from arene-epoxidation reactions catalyzed by human cytochrome P450 enzymes ",
      "Adverse Reactions": "Case ReportsTopical: Local skin irritation and allergic contact dermatitis   ; gynecomastia in prepubertal boys with repeated application of lavender and tea tree oils Oral: Disorientation, systemic contact dermatitis, coma, body rash, and neutrophil leukocytosis ",

      "Clinical Summary": "Tian Xian is an extract of Chinese medicinal herbs that is used for cancer treatment in traditional medicine. Ingredients may vary depending on manufacturers but usually include ginseng and astragalus as the main components. Proponents claim that the anticancer effects are due to the immunomodulating properties of the constituents.In vitro and animal studies demonstrate that Tian Xian has immunomodulating  and anticancer  effects. In a small randomized controlled trial, Tian Xian liquid significantly improved QOL, decreased chemotherapy side effects, and demonstrated immunomodulating effects on lymphocytes in patients with refractory metastatic breast cancer. Larger studies are needed to confirm safety and efficacy No serious adverse effects have been reported from the use of Tian Xian liquid. However, patients should use caution because some of the herbs in Tian Xian may interact with prescription drugs due to cytochrome P450 3A4 induction . Future studies are needed to determine the extent to which this herbal remedy may either positively or negatively alter conventional anticancer therapy.",

In humanized PXR mice, Tian Xian increased hepatic CYP3A11 expression and induced CYP3A4 expression, indicating its coadministration with conventional chemotherapeutic agents may be contraindicated . In models of human colorectal cancer, Tian Xian inhibits proliferation via the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway , downregulates matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2) and MMP7 mRNA expression, and increases vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNA expression, but not protein levels in vivo . It also upregulates p21 protein levels and downregulates MMP1 and multidrug resistance-1 (MDR1) protein levels . Suppression of gene expression and tumorigenicity of cancer stem-like hepatoma side population cells as well as synergy with doxorubicin also occur through inhibition of multiple oncogenic signaling pathways ",

      "Scientific Name": "Transfer Factor",
      "Clinical Summary": "Transfer factors are a complex group of more than 200 highly polar, hydrophilic, low molecular weight (<12,000 Da) proteins produced in small quantities by lymphoid cells . They can be extracted from human or animal white blood cells, or cloned lymphocytes grown in vitro, colostrum, and egg yolk. The parent lymphocyte’s delayed-type hypersensitivity and cell-mediated immunity is passed along to non-immune recipients, and appears to function across species.In animal studies, transfer factors were shown to reduce tumor size and increase peripheral blood T-lymphocyte counts  In humans, transfer factors appear to be well tolerated and have shown some efficacy in the treatment of herpes , acute infection in children , chronic fatigue syndrome , and Candidiasis . One study showed effectiveness in increasing white blood cells, CD8 lymphocytes and interleukin 2 levels among patients with HIV . However, transfer factors are ineffective in treating hepatitis , multiple sclerosis , extrinsic bronchial asthma , human warts , juvenile rheumatoid arthritis , and acne vulgaris Studies in various cancers have shown that transfer factors are ineffective in treating malignant melanoma , nasopharyngeal carcinoma , bronchogenic carcinoma , Hodgkin’s disease , osteogenic sarcoma , and mycosis fungoides . However, in a study of children with leukemia, immunization with transfer factors conferred protection against varicella-zoster infection  . Other trials have shown increased survival rates among patients with Stage I adenocarcinoma of the lung  and Stage I cervical cancer Overall, there is a paucity of large randomized controlled clinical trials, and a need for further research into the effectiveness of transfer factors.",

Human leukocyte dialysates (DLE) contain low molecular peptides that were characterized in the late 1980s as amino terminal ends of enkephalins. A low molecular weight sub fraction derived from DLE, IMREG-1, has been shown to enhance cell-mediated immunity In vitro studies have shown that cells of both murine recipients and humans treated for herpes zoster virus infection secrete gamma-interferon in response to transfer factors . Studies have also suggested that production of transfer factors, but not their immunologic activities, is regulated by immune response genes ",

      "Clinical Summary": "Tribulus is a perennial herb that grows in the subtropical regions of eastern and western Asia, southern Europe, and Africa. It is used in traditional Chinese and Indian medicine systems for chest pain, heart-related problems, dizziness, skin and eye disorders, to expel kidney stones, and as a diuretic and tonic. It is also marketed as a dietary supplement to enhance sexual function  and for body building Preliminary studies indicate that tribulus has analgesic , antihypertensive , anti-inflammatory , antiedematous , antioxidant , diuretic , hypoglycemic , antibacterial , antifungal , cardioprotective , and anticancer properties In vitro studies found that saponins in tribulus inhibit platelet aggregation . In animal models of chronic mild stress tribulus saponins produced antidepressive effects . In diabetic neuropathic pain models, a standardized tribulus extract was found to be comparable to the drug Pregabalin, with significant increases in pain threshold responses Tribulus has been shown to increase sperm production , but its effects on testosterone levels are mixed . In human studies, testosterone increases only occurred when tribulus was part of a combined supplement therapy, making it difficult to determine its contribution to this effect . In a randomized double-blind study to evaluate effects on erectile dysfunction and serum total testosterone, tribulus was not more effective than placebo . A pilot study evaluating tribulus in men with partial androgen deficiency showed significant differences in testosterone levels and erectile function, but no significant differences in levels of luteinizing hormone . In women, however, two small studies indicate improvements in sexual dysfunction . Larger randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these results. A tribulus extract used alone did not not improve androgenic status or physical performance among athletes Saponins in tribulus have shown activity against in breast  and prostate cancer cells , and may protect against UVB-induced carcinogenesis . In animal models, tribulus resulted in a significant reduction in tumor incidence, tumor burden, and cumulative number of papillomas , and relieved cisplatin-induced renal toxicity Due to its purported hormonal activities, prostate cancer patients should avoid this product.",

      "Mechanism of Action": "In vitro, cinnamic amides in tribulus fruits inhibit papain-like protease (PLpro), an essential proteolytic enzyme which plays a critical role in virus-mediated RNA replication . Di-p-coumaroylquinic acid derivatives in tribulus are associated with its antioxidant effects Aphrodisiac effects may be associated with the constituent protodioscin, which leads to an increase in some sex hormones . Erectogenic effects may also occur via conversion of protodioscin to DHEA  or by concentration-dependent relaxation of the corpus cavernosum (CC) via reactions in the nitric oxide (NO)/NO synthase pathway and CC endothelium . The NO release effect may explain observed physiological responses to tribulus supplementation, independent of testosterone level . In a study conducted in rats with ovarian cysts, tribulus extract showed a luteinizing effect related to gonadotropin-like activity Saponins exhibit cytotoxic and antihyperlipidemic effects . They may protect against atherosclerosis by suppressing angiotensin II-induced vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation via inhibition of intracellular ROS production, calcium ion mobilization, pkc-α expression, ERK1/2 phosphorylation, and proto-oncogene expression . In ischemic cells, polyphenol-mediated antioxidant activity with tribulus extract resulted in significant suppression of LDH release, ROS generation, and superoxide production In animal models, tribulus exerts a protective effect in diabetic rats by inhibiting oxidative stress  and lowering levels of glycosylated hemoglobin and cholesterols . In diabetic neuropathic pain models, tribulus modulates oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokine release in a dose-dependent manner via increases in superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and reduced glutathione and lipid peroxide levels . In chronic mild stress models, the attenuation of serum corticotropin-releasing factor and cortisol levels by tribulus saponins suggest normalization of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis hyperactivity . Antihypertensive effects occur via arterial smooth muscle relaxation, NO release, and membrane hyperpolarization . An aqueous extract also demonstrated angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibition activity  that may help lower blood pressure. Phenolic acids such as chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid may be responsible for reputed cardioprotective properties Tribulus extracts induce apoptosis and suppress cancer cell proliferation by activating caspase 3, dephosphorylating extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) 1 and 2 , and by inhibiting nuclear factor (NF-kappa B) signaling . Saponins from tribulus inhibit multiple-drug resistance of cancer cells . In breast carcinoma cell lines, a saponin extract changed mRNA levels of CXCR4, CCR7 and BCL2 genes . In models of human prostate cancer, antitumor and antiangiogenic activities are attributed to cell-cycle arrest and apoptotic induction not involving the caspase pathway . Saponins also act as a modulator of apoptosis: in normal human keratinocytes, saponins attenuate UVB-induced programmed cell death through inhibition of intrinsic apoptotic pathway, but enhance apoptotic response in squamous cell carcinomas . The photoprotective effect of saponins is attributed to enhanced NER gene expression and inhibition of UVB-mediated NF-kappaB activation . In animal models, a hydroalcoholic extract of tribulus relieved cisplatin-induced renal toxicity, perhaps via diuretic effects that increase drug excretion, scavenging free radicals via increase in antioxidant enzymes, suppressing inflammatory agents, and acting on organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2) proteins Tribulus extract was shown to limit formation of calcium oxalate and calcium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate crystals , mineral compounds that can cause kidney stones.Consumption of tribulus causes motor neuron adverse effects in animals by affecting the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors . The steroidal saponin diosgenin is thought to be responsible for hepatotoxic effects associated with tribulus ",

      "Clinical Summary": "Triphala is an herbal formulation that is widely used in Ayurveda for the treatment of various ailments . It consists of equal portions of dried and powdered fruits of three medicinal plants: Emblica officinalis (Amalaki)Terminalia chebula (Haritaki), and Terminalia belerica (Bibhitaki)  and may also be combined with Guggulu, a tree gum resin, for additional therapeutic effects. Triphala is used to treat dental caries, anemia, jaundice, constipation, asthma, fever, chronic ulcers, inflammation, obesity, and to promote immunity against infections such as pneumonia, tuberculosis, and AIDS.In animal models, Triphala showed hypolipidemic  and enteroprotective effects against methotrexate-induced damage . Triphala also alleviated colitis  and bromobenzene-induced nephrotoxicity . Other animal studies have demonstrated antiobesity , antiarthritic, and anti-inflammatory  properties. However, none of these effects have been tested in clinical trials.In humans, several studies compared the anti-plaque efficacy of Triphala mouthwash to that of chlorhexidine, although results are mixed . Another study found that Triphala may actually promote oral bacterial biofilm formation . In a pilot study of healthy human volunteers, Triphala demonstrated immunostimulatory effects . Triphala rinse may help to reverse tobacco-induced oral precancerous lesions . More studies are needed to validate these effects.Triphala may cause gastrointestinal side effects.",

      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "Polyphenols and flavonoids in Triphala are thought to be responsible for many of its effects. Gallic acid, a major polyphenol, has antioxidant and immunomodulatory properties In laboratory studies, one of the components of Triphala known as Terminalia chebula was shown to be a potent hyaluronidase and collagenase inhibitor that prevented degradation of cartilage . In animal models, bromobenzen-induced nephrotoxic effects were reduced via increased antioxidant enzyme activity . Antiarthritic and anti-flammatory effects are linked to NF-kBp65 and COX-2 inhibition , and its anticolitic effects are linked to its antioxidant activity and presence of flavonoids Triphala also appears to stimulate neutrophil function and decrease corticosterone levels in immunized rats exposed to noise stress . In a small study of healthy human volunteers, Triphala increased cytotoxic T cells and natural killer cells Triphala may have radioprotective effects  through inhibition of oxidative damage in cells and organs. Triphala also increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) in MCF-7 and T-47D breast cancer cells resulting in apoptosis , and protected mice from radiation-induced mortality Despite its antibacterial properties, compounds in Triphala may promote the formation of oral bacterial biofilm formation via activation of glucosyl transferases ",

      "How It Works": "Turmeric demonstrated anti-inflammatory and anticancer activities in lab studies. A few studies suggest that curcumin has biological activity in some cancer patients but more data are needed to verify its benefits.\nTurmeric is a spice that has been used in cooking for centuries. Scientists have determined that turmeric has many biological activities, although they do not fully understand exactly how it exerts these effects. From laboratory experiments, it has been deduced that substances in turmeric (called curcuminoids) prevent inflammation by inhibiting the molecules that mediate inflammatory reactions. Curcuminoids may protect the body in a few ways: they enhance the activity of an important detoxifying enzyme and they also act as antioxidants by neutralizing free radicals (which can cause DNA damage). In rats, turmeric prevented the development of kidney damage from toxins. Turmeric also stimulates the flow of bile in the gastrointestinal tract.\nIn rats exposed to cancer-causing substances, those that were treated with turmeric were protected from colon, stomach, and skin cancers. Turmeric also stops the replication of tumor cells when applied directly to them in the laboratory, but it is unknown if this effect occurs in the human body. Curcumin, a curcuminoid, has shown biological activity in pancreatic cancer patients and there are ongoing studies to test its effect as an addition to current cancer treatment. However, recent experiments have suggested that turmeric might interfere with the activity of some chemotherapy drugs in breast cancer, so the question remains whether this spice is helpful or harmful during chemotherapy. Curcumin also showed weak phytoestrogenic activity in a laboratory study. Human data are needed.",

      "Clinical Summary": "Turmeric is a plant that is native to South Asia but is cultivated in tropical areas around the world. The rhizome is used as a spice in regional cuisines, and as a coloring agent in food and cosmetics for its yellow-orange color. It is also used in traditional medicine for improving circulation and digestion. Turmeric extracts are marketed as dietary supplements to improve memory, for arthritis, and for cancer prevention.The active constituents are turmerone oil and water-soluble curcuminoids, mainly curcumin which is the focus of most research. In vitro studies suggest that curcumin, the principal bioactive ingredient of turmeric, acts as a weak phytoestrogen , and exhibits neuroprotective , choleretic , anti-inflammatory , immunomodulatory , anti-proliferative , and chemopreventive effects . Curcumin, its analogs, and liposomal formulations have also produced chemosensitizing  and radiosensitizing effects Turmeric and its active constituents have been investigated for their therapeutic activities in humans. Data from an epidemiological study suggest improved cognitive performance in elderly Asians who consume turmeric in the form of curry powder ; however, no benefits from curcumin supplementation were detected in patients with Alzheimer’s disease . Turmeric may help alleviate symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome,  quiescent ulcerative colitis , and may be effective against major depressive disorder . Turmeric extract was found to be safe and equally effective as a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug for the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee . Whether curcumin supplementation increases cholesterol levels is unclear, as study results are mixed . In a study of postmenopausal women, consumption of curcumin along with aerobic exercise training were shown to improve vascular endothelial function Turmeric also has anticancer effects. In patients with colorectal cancer, oral curcumin administered during the pre-surgery waiting period improved cachexia and the general health of patients . In a phase II trial of oral curcumin in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer, no treatment-related toxic effects were observed, and clinically relevant biological activity was seen in two patients despite limited absorption . In another study, supplementation with a blend of green tea, pomegranate, broccoli and curcumin resulted in a reduction in the rate of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) increase among men with prostate cancer following a PSA relapse post-radical treatment In early phase studies, a combination of curcumin and docetaxel was shown to be safe . Curcumin with gemcitabine was also found to be safe and feasible for further study , but a high-dose of curcumin must be used to achieve systemic effect Preliminary data suggest effectiveness of a topical turmeric-based cream for reduction of radiotherapy-induced dermatitis in patients with head and neck cancer Curcumin is known to interfere with cytochrome P450 enzymes  and may interact with chemotherapy drugs like cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin . Overall, the development of turmeric for clinical use needs further investigation due to its inherent poor absorption, rapid metabolism, complex mechanistic profile, and largely preclinical data.",
      "Food Sources": "Turmeric is a major ingredient in curry powder, a spice commonly found in South Asian food.",
      "Purported Uses2": [
        "Cancer prevention",
        "Infections",
        "Inflammation",
        "Kidney stones",
        "Stomach and intestinal gas"
      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "The hepatoprotective effects of curcumin, the most researched active constituent in turmeric, may occur via MMP-13 induction and TGF-alpha inhibition , as well as anti-apoptotic/anti-necrotic mechanisms . However, it has also been shown to inhibit cell-cycle progression during normal liver regeneration A  meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials revealed that curcumin is effective in decreasing the concentration of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, a key mediator in many inflammatory diseases  In vitro and animal studies of lung models point to anti-proliferative and modulatory mechanisms involving inhibition of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 Stat3 pathway , matrix metalloproteinase, and vascular endothelial growth factor ; caspase- and mitochondria-dependent apoptosis ; and cyclin-dependent kinase downregulation . Curcumin also appears to have synergistic effects with isoflavones, suppressing the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) production in prostate cells through anti-androgen effects \nStudies done on breast cancer show that curcumin may inhibit chemotherapy-induced apoptosis via inhibition of the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) . Data also suggest that curcumin induces apoptosis in human colon cancer cells independent of p21 expression . Curcumin’s antitumor actions appear to be due to its interactions with arachidonate metabolism and its in vivo antiangiogenic properties . Another possible chemopreventive mechanism maybe via binding and activating the vitamin D receptor (VDR), thereby protecting the small intestine and colon where VDRs are expressed and vitamin D is known to serve an anticancer function . Curcumin also inhibited growth of uterine leiomyosarcoma cells by targeting the AKT-mTOR (RAC-alpha serine-threonine-protein kinase; mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway . And recent findings indicate that curcumin inhibits progression of bladder cancer by down-regulating the expression of beta-catenin, high levels of which are associated with several cancers Another study found that CRM1, an important nuclear exportin, is a cellular target of curcumin; and that the inhibition of nuclear traffic by curcumin may be responsible for its many biological effects ",

      "How It Works": "Ukrain has not been shown to prevent or treat cancer, but may be useful as palliative care in some instances.\nUkrain is an alkaloid extract from the plant Chelidonium majus, a common weed. It was developed over 20 years ago by a scientist from the Ukraine, who tested the product on patients with several different types of cancers. In lab experiments, Ukrain was found to kill cancer cells while leaving healthy cells alone. This may occur by disrupting changes in cell structure during cell division. Because cancer cells divide more rapidly than healthy cells, such a disruption could slow the growth of cancer cells, causing their death. Some lab experiments suggest that Ukrain may stimulate certain aspects of the immune system, but it is uncertain if these effects could occur in humans. Two small studies suggest Ukrain may be helpful for advanced pancreatic cancer patients, but additional studies are needed to confirm effects and safety.",
      "Purported Uses": [
        [
          "To prevent and treat cancer",
          "Two small pilot studies suggest that Ukrain may be useful in the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer, but there were also side effects that may be related to its use. More studies are needed to confirm safety and effects."

          "To stimulate the immune system",
          "Although lab studies suggest that Ukrain stimulates the activity of certain immune cells, human data are lacking."

      ],
      "Side Effects": [
        "Nausea",
        "Soreness at injection site",
        "Diarrhea",
        "Dizziness",
        "Fatigue",

        "Excessive urination",
        "Slight fever",
        "Possible tumor bleeding, as reported in a small study"
      ],
      "Special Point": "Anecdotes suggest effectiveness in humans, but adequately controlled clinical trials have not been published. Ukrain™ is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration but is available in parts of Europe and from Tijuana clinics. Although the product labeling makes claims of effectiveness and safety, none of these claims have been sufficiently proven.",
      "Brand Name": "Ukrain™ (Nowicky Pharma, Vienna, Austria)",
      "Clinical Summary": "Ukrain™ is a semi-synthetic proprietary product derived from the common weed Chelidonium majus or greater celandine that contains alkaloids and thiophosphoric acid . Patients use it to treat HIV/AIDS and hepatitis C, but it is mainly promoted as an alternative anticancer agent.In vitro data suggest that Ukrain may increase total T-cell count and T-helper lymphocytes, decrease T-suppressor cells, and activate splenic lymphocytes . Antitumor effects in vitro and in animal studies have also been reported . In breast cancer and melanoma cells, Ukrain may have a synergistic effect when used with bortezomib . Preliminary studies in humans indicate it may be beneficial in the palliative care setting  and prolong survival in pancreatic cancer patients when administered with gemcitabine . A systematic review of clinical trials also suggests it may have anticancer potential . Large-scale studies are needed to confirm this effect.Reported adverse effects include injection site reactions, slight fever, fatigue, dizziness, nausea, and possibly tumor bleeding.Ukrain™ is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration but is available in parts of Europe and from Tijuana clinics.",

        "Hepatitis",
        "HIV and AIDS",
        "Immunostimulation"
      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "Proposed activity includes cytotoxicity from effects on cellular oxygen consumption, and inhibition of DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis. In vitro studies demonstrate weak inhibition of tubulin polymerization causing cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase . Proapoptotic effects are particularly attributed to alkaloid constituents including chelidonine Constituents such as thiophosphoric acid and other derivatives may also contribute to its anticancer activities Ukrain switches epithelial–mesenchymal transitions in malignant renal cell carcinoma , and exerts an antiproliferative effect on pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells by targeting mitotic spindle microtubules . In animal models, Ukrain restored pro-inflammatory functions of hypoxic macrophages ",
      "Adverse Reactions": "Parenteral administration: Soreness at injection site, nausea, diarrhea, dizziness, fatigue, drowsiness, polydipsia, polyuria, and slight fever.\nHematological side effects and tumor bleeding were reported in a recent phase II trial.",

      "How It Works": "Valerian may provide modest improvements in sleep, but study results are mixed.\nIn laboratory experiments, valerian extract prevents the breakdown of an important inhibitory neurotransmitter chemical in the nervous system, causing a calming effect. Human studies suggest valerian products have a modest effect to improve sleep quality. Valerian supplements often have a distinct odor that some may find unpleasant, and these products might interact with a number of drugs or health conditions. More research is needed to determine the benefits and safety of this botanical.",

      "Scientific Name": "Valeriana officinalis, Valeriana jatamansi, Valeriana fauriei, Valeriana wallichii",
      "Clinical Summary": "Derived from the root of the plant V. officinalis, valerian is sold as a dietary supplement for calmness, sedation, and to improve sleep quality. Other species including V. jatamansiV. fauriei, and V. wallichii are also used in traditional medicine to treat insomnia and anxiety. Valerian products are usually available in extracts or teas that have a distinct odor.In vitro, valerian exhibits antioxidant , cytoprotective , and neuroprotective  effects. In animal models, valerian has demonstrated antihypertensive, antispasmotic , anxiolytic , and antidepressant , but not sedative  effects. Human studies show that valerian has modest effects on improving sleep quality , but its sleep-inducing properties are not superior to placebo . Valerian also failed to improve sleep in a study of cancer patients . Other studies suggest that valerian can reduce hot flashes  and dysmenorrhea , facilitate supervised benzodiazepine withdrawal , and relieve symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder . However, sample sizes in these studies are too small to draw firm conclusions. Reviews of the clinical literature have also concluded the evidence for valerian as an anxiolytic in humans is insufficient The valerian derivative isovaleroxy-hydroxy dihydrovaltrate showed anticancer effects against human ovarian cancer cells in vitro and in vivo . Chlorovaltrates in valerian have shown moderate cytotoxicity against lung, prostate, colon and liver cancer cell lines . However, no clinical trials on these effects have been conducted.Although valerian products are generally safe, cases of liver and pancreatic toxicity have been reported . Valerian inhibits CYP3A4 enzymes and P-glycoprotein  transporters and is prone to interact with many drugs . Valerian is also thought to have estrogenic activities , but this is not observed in vitro ",
      "Purported Uses2": [
        "Anxiety",
        "Insomnia",
        "Menstrual cramps",
        "Menopausal symptoms",
        "Sedation",
        "Spasms"
      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "In vitro, valerian protects against lipid peroxidation, deoxyribose degradation, and reactive oxygen species production . Iridoids, germacrane-type sesquiterpenoids, and lignans in valerian are associated with neuroprotective effects . Valerian constituents can also bind to various neurotransmitter receptors implicated in circadian rhythms and anxiety such as serotonin receptors . In vitro and animal models indicate that anxiolytic activity is due to valerenic acid (VA) which could be inhibited by VA derivatives such as hydroxy-VA that do not modulate gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptors . VA in animals inhibits the enzyme system responsible for central catabolism of GABA, increasing GABA concentration and decreasing CNS activity, and direct binding of this constituent to GABA-receptors has been demonstrated . VA interaction with the GABAAergic system has been noted to act in a manner similar to that of benzodiazepines . Sesquiterpenes and valepotriates were identified as having varying levels of antidepressant activity . Chronic treatment of rodents with valepotriate-rich extract increased norepinephrine and dopamine levels . Valerian exhibits antispasmodic and hypotensive effects via potassium channel (KATP) activation, which may be useful in gastrointestinal and cardiovascular disorders . Valerian also exhibited a protective effect against vasopressin-induced coronary spasm and pressor response, suggesting coronary and systemic vasodilation Valerian iridoids may have choleretic activity and this may increase the risk of gallstone formation, and therefore explain the increased risk for development of acute pancreatitis ",
      "Warnings": [
        "Valerian should be discontinued at least 1 week before surgery because it may interact with anesthesia",
        "Patients should not drive or operate dangerous machinery after taking valerian as it could disrupt information processing, task performance, and vigilance",
        "Abrupt discontinuation of valerian in those who may have developed a dependency may cause benzodiazepine-like withdrawal"
      ],
      "Contraindications": [
        [
          "Patients with liver or pancreatic disease should avoid valerian as there have been case reports of hepatotoxicity",
          "as well as a possible association of valerian iridoids with an increased risk for development of acute pancreatitis"
        ],
        "Patients should not drive or operate dangerous machinery when taking valerian as early studies indicate that single-dose valerian could disrupt information processing, task performance, and vigilance in humans 1–2 hours post-administration",
        "Individuals who are pregnant or nursing should avoid valerian, as it has not adequately been studied and preliminary animal models indicate some adverse effects on fetal brain development"
      ],
      "Adverse Reactions": "Occasional, anecdotal, or possibly related: Headache, diarrhea and other gastrointestinal complaints, daytime sedation/dullness, impaired alertness, depression, irritability, dizziness, sweating, heart palpitations, bitter taste, benzodiazepine-like withdrawal symptoms with supplement cessation Case Reports\nHepatotoxicity: Two separate cases in women with the use of valerian products, with eventual symptom resolution after discontinuation Risk of acute pancreatitis: A case-control study identified valerian use as a potential contributor to cases of idiopathic acute pancreatitis Fetal development: Valerian administration in pregnant mice significantly reduced zinc levels in the fetal brain ",
      "Herb-Drug Interactions": "Barbiturates: Valerian prolonged pentobarbital-induced sleep in animal models Benzodiazepines: Valerian may have synergistic effects Haloperidol: Valerian may have an additive effect, causing hepatic damage Cytochrome P450 (CYP450) substrates: Valerian inhibits CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, and can affect the serum concentration of drugs metabolized by these enzymes.P-glycoprotein (P-gp)substrates: Valerian inhibits P-gp transporters and can increase the intracellular concentration of substrate drugs UGT (Uridine 5’-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase) substrates: Valerian modulates UGT enzymes in vitro and can increase the side effects of drugs metabolized by them ",

      "How It Works": "There is no scientific evidence that Viacreme can enhance sexual pleasure in women.\nViacreme is a topical cream that contains menthol and L-arginine. It is being promoted to increase sexual response in women by sensitizing the genital area. Many cancer patients may have painful intercourse and difficulty in maintaining arousal resulting from stress, hormonal changes, cancer treatments, or use of antidepressants. The manufacturer claims application of Viacreme in the clitoral region results in genital warming and increased clitoral sensitivity. The L-arginine increases blood flow to the genital tissue. However, this claim is not supported by clinical studies and the positive results of Viacreme may be due to a placebo effect. This product has not been studied in cancer patients.",

      "Clinical Summary": "Viacreme is a topical formulation of menthol and L-arginine in an aqueous base. It is promoted to enhance sexual responsiveness in women by sensitizing the genital area. Cancer patients may experience symptoms of sexual dysfunction that include painful intercourse, loss of libido, and difficulty in maintaining arousal. These problems may be caused by factors such as stress, hormonal changes, and treatment involving surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, or hormone therapy. Application of Viacreme is believed to cause genital warming and increase clitoral sensitivity, although these results may be due to placebo effects.No clinical trials have been conducted to study the efficacy of Viacreme.

      "How It Works": "Vinpocetine may be useful against some cerebrovascular disorders. It has not been shown to treat or prevent cancer.Vinpocetine is made from a compound found in the common periwinkle plant. It was developed in Europe as a drug but sold in the United States as a dietary supplement to improve brain function. Vinpocetine was shown to increase blood flow to the brain and has been studied as a treatment for Alzheimer’s disease and for disorders of the nervous and circulatory systems. However, more studies are needed before it can be recommended. Vinpocetine should not be confused with the chemo drugs vincristine and vinblastine, which are also made from compounds of the periwinkle plant.",

      "Clinical Summary": "Vinpocetine is derived from vincamine, an alkaloid found in the common periwinkle plant. Originally developed in Europe where it is marketed as a drug called Cavinton, vinpocetine is sold in the United States as a dietary supplement to improve brain function.Animal models suggest that vinpocetine has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antimitotic, anti-atherogenic, antithrombotic, and antiepileptic effects . Human studies show that vinpocetine enhances short-term memory , cognitive performance , and improves chronic cerebral dysfunction in elderly patients . It has also been studied as a potential treatment for Alzheimer’s disease , but a systematic review did not find evidence of its benefits . Parenteral followed by oral administration of vinpocetine significantly maintained beneficial hemorheologic changes in stroke patients in one pilot study , but a systematic review did not find enough evidence to determine whether vinpocetine could benefit patients with acute ischemic stroke Vinpocetine inhibits the growth of breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo . In animal studies, it potentiates the effects of radiation therapy in tumor cells . However, vinpocetine has not yet been studied in humans for its potential anticancer effects.Vinpocetine should not be confused with chemotherapy drugs such as vincristine or vinblastine, which are also alkaloids derived from the periwinkle plant.",

      "Mechanism of Action": "Vinpocetine is a synthetic ethyl ester of apovincamine derived from an alkaloid in the common periwinkle plant .  Vinpocetine has been shown to possess antioxidant and hydroxyl radical scavenging properties in vitro . It inhibits phosphodiesterase 1 (PDE1) activity and improves cerebral blood flow by elevating cGMP and cAMP, increasing mitochondrial function, and improving glucose and oxygen utilization by the brain. Vinpocetine helps improve spatial memory in rats through its ability to prevent neuronal damage and to favorably modulate cholinergic function . It demonstrated antiepileptic effects by suppressing abnormal neuronal excitability through the regulation of sodium channels and release of dopamine in the striatal nerve endings . Vinpocetine antagonizes platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-induced extracellular matrix synthesis, suppresses intracellular reactive oxidative species (ROS) production, and inhibits extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 activation and vascular smooth muscle cell growth . Anti-atherogenic effects occur through inhibition of monocyte adhesion, oxidative stress, and inflammatory responses mediated by protein kinase B (Akt)/nuclear factor kappa B (NF-ĸB)-dependent pathways . Vinpocetine also demonstrates anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α)-induced NF-κB activities  as well as Akt and STAT3 activation . Administration of vinpocetine to chronic stroke patients increased glucose uptake and release in unaffected areas of the brain . In a study using mouse model of otitis media, vinpocetine suppresses S. pneumonia-induced mucus production through the inhibition of mucin MUC5AC In vitro and in vivo studies indicate vinpocetine antitumor activity against human breast cancer cells occurs through G0/G1-phase cell cycle arrest and mitochondrial pathways of apoptosis . Vinpocetine can also increase the effects of radiation by increasing tumor oxygenation ",
      "Contraindications": "Patients with low blood pressure, a history of heart problems or strokes, or those on blood-thinning medications should consult their physician before using this product.",
      "Adverse Reactions": "Rare: Flushing, rashes, gastrointestinal problems , hypotension Case Report: A 73 year-old man developed agranulocytosis after using vinpocetine for 50 days. His symptoms resolved after discontinuing vinpocetine ",

      "How It Works": "Vitamin A is essential for many bodily functions. It is unclear if taking extra vitamin A can prevent cancer.Vitamin A is best obtained from a well-balanced diet. Obtaining the recommended Daily Value of vitamin A (DV: 5,000 IU) is essential for a variety of bodily functions, including vision, embryonic development, tissue integrity, and proper immune activation.Many fruits and vegetables are rich in vitamin A precursors, such as beta-carotene and cryptoxanthin, which are converted into the active form retinol. Dairy products, eggs, and fish are among the foods containing vitamin A already preformed as retinol. Too much retinol can cause a variety of side effects.Scientists are studying vitamin A byproducts that may be useful in cancer therapies, but these treatments are different from extra vitamin A taken in the form of supplements, the overuse of which can produce harmful effects including liver problems.",

It may also increase risk of prostate cancer. However, overall nutritional status and diet of cancer patients is important, and a diet rich in nutrients rather than from supplements is unlikely to produce unwanted side effects. For cancer patients especially, any perceived vitamin deficiencies should be discussed with their oncology healthcare professional."

Vitamin A and its analogs such as beta-carotene, alpha-carotene, and cryptoxanthin are used as prescription drugs and as dietary supplements to improve vision, skin condition, immune function, or growth and development in children, and to treat and prevent cancer, eczema , and hepatitis C . In children, vitamin A may also reduce recurring urinary tract infection , parasitic infections , and along with zinc may reduce malaria-related morbidity Preliminary studies suggest Vitamin A supplementation may inhibit progression of multiple sclerosis  and improve fatigue and depression Vitamin A supplementation was thought to benefit children  and affect immune response to specific vaccines . However, other studies yielded conflicting results , and more recent large trials do not support neonatal supplementation . Maternal supplementation also did not affect neonatal mortality  or improve intelligence, memory, or motor function in children Some studies found that late-stage breast cancer patients have lower serum vitamin A levels , and that diets richer in micronutrients including vitamin A can improve immune functioning and prognosis in head and neck cancer patients , and reduce the risk of oral and pharyngeal cancers . However, vitamin A supplementation does not have a protective effect against non-small cell lung cancer  or prolong survival for melanoma patients , and may actually elevate the risk of prostate cancer Vitamin A is fat-soluble and overuse may cause accumulation in the body.

      "Mechanism of Action": "Vitamin A is essential for many aspects of ocular metabolism, including conjunctival and corneal epithelial maintenance, retinal phototransduction, and retinal pigment epithelial cell viability . Nuclear receptor transcription factors are central to vitamin A activity, and most transcriptional actions require the retinoic acid receptor/retinoid x receptor (RXR/RAR) heterodimer . Transcriptional changes are linked to epigenetic changes in histones and DNA via recruitment of epigenetic modifying enzymes All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) has been identified as the most important active metabolite in vitamin A for tissue homeostasis in adults and segmentation control in developing organisms . As such, retinoids that include ATRA along with natural and synthetic derivatives exhibit anticancer properties linked to their ability to induce cellular differentiation and growth suppression In animal models of melanoma, ATRA in combination with epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate (EGCG) from green tea enhanced 67-kDa laminin receptor expression and increased EGCG-induced cell growth inhibition . In estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer cells, ATRA halts telomerase activity and exerts antitumor effects via a rapid decrease of H3-K9 acetylation at the hTERT promoter . The protective effect of supplemental retinol against melanoma may be mediated by sunlight exposure In multiple sclerosis patients, vitamin A supplementation as retinyl palmitate upregulated TGF-beta and FoxP3 gene expression  and decreased IFN-gamma and T-bet gene expression Vitamin A competes with vitamin D for the same parathyroid hormone receptor ",

      "How It Works": "Vitamin B12, in combination with folate and vitamin B6, may reduce the risk for some cancers, but not others.Vitamin B12 is involved in the synthesis of phospholipids, neurotransmitters, DNA, and the metabolism of fatty acids and amino acids in cells. It is found in meat, fish, dairy products, and fortified cereals.A number of studies have evaluated B12, folic acid, and B6 as part of homocysteine-lowering therapy. This is because elevated homocysteine levels can be a marker for various conditions including heart disease, depression, cognitive disorders, and risk of fracture incidence. However, findings are mixed on whether long-term supplementation with this combination improves fracture risk or medical conditions even when it lowers homocysteine levels.Some large studies suggest this supplement combination may lower the risks for cervical cancer, but not lung or invasive cancers, and results are mixed for breast cancer. Another study found an increased cancer incidence when evaluating only B12 taken with folic acid, although results suggested these effects were related to folic acid. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings.Since vitamin B12 is found in many foods, a deficiency is more common in the elderly, strict vegetarians, or those who take oral contraceptives, or medications for gastric disorders or insulin resistance. High levels of folic acid intake may mask a B12 deficiency. Patients should discuss supplement use with their physicians.",

      "Scientific Name": "Cyanocobalamin",
      "Clinical Summary": "Vitamin B12, part of the vitamin B-complex family, refers to the group of compounds that consists of cyanocobalamin, hydroxycobalamin, and related substances . It is essential for normal nerve function, DNA synthesis, hematopoiesis, fatty acid metabolism, and amino acid synthesis in the mitochondria. It also plays an important role in homocysteine metabolism.Vitamin B12 is abundant in diets that include meat and dairy products, although a deficiency can occur in those who have malabsorption syndromes , take medications for gastric disorders  or for conditions associated with insulin resistance , or those who follow a strict vegetarian diet . B12 deficiency is also more common among the elderly . Lack of B12 can lead to a wide variety of hematologic, neurologic, and psychiatric disorders, and may increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases . Vitamin B12 is often included in vitamin products used to reduce homocysteine which is associated with cardiovascular diseases. High dietary intakes of B vitamins including B12 have been associated with a decreased risk for cataracts . However, combination supplementation with B12, B6, and folic acid may actually increase the risk of cataract extraction Although low serum B12 levels have been associated with increased bone turnover and fracture risk , long-term B12 and folic acid supplementation did not improve bone mineral density  or reduce osteoporotic fracture incidence in elderly individuals with elevated plasma homocysteine levels Repletion of vitamin B12 may improve response in patients resistant to antidepressants , and in older adults with major depression, long-term supplementation with a combination of B12, B6, and folic acid enhanced antidepressant treatment efficacy . However, among middle-age and older women, this combination homocysteine-lowering supplementation over 7 years’ average treatment duration did not result in reduced depression risk compared with placebo, despite significant homocysteine level reductions Homocystene-lowering therapy may have some cardiovascular benefits after coronary interventions , but does not appear to reduce risk of further cardiovascular events including stroke . In addition, increased risk of in-stent restenosis with such treatment has been reported in patients after coronary stenting . In a large Dutch study known as the B-PROOF trial, 2 years of B12 and folic acid supplementation in hyperhomocysteinemic elderly patients also had no effect on arterial stiffness and atherosclerosis . In a long-term field study of individuals residing in India at high altitude however, B12 and folic acid supplementation reduced thrombosis incidence . A large study of B12, folic acid, and B6 supplementation to prevent recurrent ischemic stroke among a large Chinese population is underway B12 as part of homocysteine-lowering therapy or B12 repletion therapy  does not improve cognitive function , even though low-normal B12 concentrations are associated with poorer memory performance . This was further echoed in secondary data from the aforementioned B-PROOF study which showed improving homocysteine levels does not improve cognitive outcomes , although the intervention may positvely affect gait and physical performance in the elderly Increased intake of B12, folate and B6 may lower the risks for breast  and cervical  cancers, but not lung cancer . In fact, long-term use of vitamin B12 supplement is associated with increased risk of lung cancer, especially in male smokers . Another large study did not find an effect with this combination on overall risk of invasive cancer or breast cancer . However, data from a Norwegian study suggest higher cancer incidence and mortality in patients with ischemic heart disease following B12 and folic acid supplementation , although these effects appeared to be mediated by folic acid. Dietary intake of folate and B12 during pregnancy is associated with a lower risk for acute lymphoblastic leukemia in children . Further studies are needed to confirm these findings.Intramuscular B12 injections and oral folic acid reduces toxicity of pemetrexed chemotherapy in patients with non-small cell lung cancer , and may also help to improve treatment efficacy , whereas oral administration of vitamin B12 for this purpose does not A large Danish population study identified high plasma B12 levels as related to elevated risks for hematological, smoking-related, and alcohol-related cancers  and that cancer patients with elevated B12 levels had higher mortality than those with normal values . However, such elevations are probably are due to changes in cobalamin metabolism caused by the cancer. It does not suggest that B12 supplementation can cause cancer.",

      "Mechanism of Action": "Vitamin B12 is involved in the transfer of methyl groups and methylation reactions essential for the synthesis of phospholipids and neurotransmitters in the central nervous system. B12 is also required for synthesis of nucleic acid, notably DNA, the metabolism of fatty acids and amino acids in the mitochondria, and in delivering SAMe, the universal methyl donor . In humans, two enzymatic reactions dependent on B12 are produced and activated in two separate cellular compartments: methylcobalamin in the cytosol and adenosylcobalamin in the mitochondria . As a coenzyme in methyl transfer reactions, it converts homocysteine to methionine, and it also participates in L-methylmalonyl-coenzyme A (CoA) conversion to succinyl-CoA . In the first enzyme reaction, methylcobalamin is used to recycle the folate cofactor 5-methyltetrahydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate thereby allowing the folate cofactor to participate in a cycle involving the biosynthesis of purines and pyrimidines. During this reaction, homocysteine is converted to methionine yielding the methyl groups required for methylation that is essential in biosynthesis When used with pemetrexed, B12/folic acid therapy further increases sub-G1 populations in human adenocarcinoma and large-cell carcinoma cell lines, independent of p53 status ",
      "Contraindications": "Vitamin B12 may increase the risk of in-stent restenosis in patients after coronary stenting ",
      "Adverse Reactions": "Case report\nRosacea fulminans: In a 17-year-old girl after consumption of high doses of vitamins B6 and B12 for 2 weeks Higher cancer incidence and mortality occurred in patients with ischemic heart disease following supplementation with vitamin B12 and folic acid , although these effects appeared to be mediated by folic acid.",
      "Herb-Drug Interactions": "Proton pump inhibitors or histamine type 2 (H2)-receptor antagonists: Medications to treat gastric disorders that interfere with or suppress gastric acid and intrinsic factor production can lead to decreased vitamin B12 absorption Biguanides (metformin): Medications used to treat type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and polycystic ovary syndrome can lead to decreased vitamin B12 absorption Folic acid: Ingesting amounts greater than the Tolerable Upper Intake Level may mask vitamin B12 deficiency symptoms Oral contraceptives: May lower serum vitamin B12 concentrations ",

      "How It Works": "Obtaining vitamin B6 through diet may help to reduce the risk of certain cancers, but using B6 supplements does not prevent cancer or reduce chemotherapy side effects.Vitamin B6 is necessary for many physiological processes in the human body. These include reactions of cellular respiration, the release of glucose stores, and amino acid metabolism. Getting B6 through diet along with other nutrients is associated with cancer-preventive effects, but it cannot reduce side effects from chemotherapy. Even though lab studies show that B6 can have protective effects, high levels can also be toxic and cause nerve damage. B6 is readily available in food and deficiencies are uncommon. If a deficiency is suspected, it is important to see a healthcare practitioner to ensure correct diagnosis and supplement dosage.",
      "Purported Uses": [
        [
          "To prevent cancer",
          "Various studies show that nutrients including B6 obtained through diet have cancer-preventive effects, but this does not mean these same effects occur with supplements. In fact, long-term use of vitamin B6 supplement may increase the risk of lung cancer in male smokers."

      "Scientific Name": "Pyridoxine",
      "Clinical Summary": "Vitamin B6 or pyridoxine, as part of the water-soluble vitamin B-complex family, is actually a mixture of 6 inter-convertible pyridine vitamers, or related compounds: pyridoxine, pyridoxamine, pyridoxal, and their 5′-phosphorylated forms . Although plants and microorganisms can synthesize B6 on their own, humans must acquire it from dietary sources. Because vitamin B6 is abundant in meats, fish, poultry, shellfish, leafy green vegetables, legumes, fruits, and whole grains, deficiencies are rare. For example, patients taking the antituberculosis drug isoniazide need to take vitamin B6 to prevent drug-induced peripheral neuropathy. Patients may use supplemental B6 to treat symptoms related to heart disease, hypertension, morning sickness, peripheral neuropathies, carpal tunnel syndrome, and diabetes.Preclinical studies show that systemic administration of certain B vitamins including B6 has neuroprotective, antihypertensive , antinociceptive , and antitumor effects . In humans, higher B6 intake may lower serum homocysteine concentrations , but did not reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes . High dietary intakes of folate and B6 have been associated with reduced risk of mortality from stroke, coronary heart disease, and heart failure . Vitamin B6 supplementation did not improve cognition in older adults  and was not more effective than placebo for carpal tunnel syndrome . There is also limited evidence of its effect on asthma susceptibility or established disease . Data on its use for premenstrual syndrome is mixed , and evidence is limited and weak for the prevention of pregnancy-related nausea Some studies suggest a beneficial role for vitamin B6 in preventing colorectal cancer , and lower intake of dietary vitamin B6 is associated with increased risk of gastric adenocarcinoma  and pancreatic cancer . However, conclusions from the Women’s Health Study indicate that supplementation with vitamins B6,B12, and folate did not decrease breast cancer risk , nor did it have an effect on overall risk of invasive cancer or breast cancer . Long-term vitamin B6 supplement intake is associated with increased risk of lung cancer, especially in male smokers . Vitamin B6 administration is ineffective in preventing chemotherapy-associated hand-foot syndrome (HFS; also known as palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia [PPE]) , with limited evidence suggesting that higher doses might be needed . In one study, it did reduce the need for capecitabine dose modifications and incidence of severe HFS, but did not positively impact chemotherapy effects . A multi-arm trial to evaluate therapies including high-dose B6 for peripheral neuropathy did not find it more effective than placebo High B6 intakes can have toxic effects including sensory and motor neuropathies, and some case reports of neurotoxicity have not been reversible . B6 levels can also be elevated due to environmental exposures or genetic defects ",
      "Food Sources": "Meats, fish, shellfish, poultry, leafy green vegetables, legumes, fruits, and whole grains ",

      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "Vitamin B6 is a coenzyme in the folate metabolism pathway. Its phosphorylated metabolites are involved in amino acid metabolism, the transsulfuration pathway of homocysteine to cysteine, and glycogen phosphorylase activity which mobilizes glucose from glycogen . It is a cofactor along with cystathionine b synthase and cystathionase to produce cysteine and glutathione from their precursor homocysteine . Pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) is the major coenzyme form, the most abundant in animal tissue, and the cofactor for over 100 enzymes used in amino acid metabolism, including aminotransferases, decarboxylases, racemases, and dehydrases. It also facilitates mobilization of glucose units from glycogen via glycogen phosphorylase . PLP is also the active antiemetic form of B6, of which pyridoxine and pyridoxal have been identified as prodrugs In animal models, an excess-pyridoxine diet actively influenced cell-mediated immunity via enhanced IFN-γ production and Th1-polarization . In several cancer cell lines, B6 contributed to increased p21 gene expression via p53 activation . Proposed mechanisms for an inverse relationship of B6 intake and serum PLP with cancer risk include: 1) its participation in one-carbon metabolism that is essential for DNA synthesis, repair, and methylation; 2) the high uracil and chromosome breaks caused by B6 deficiency which may interfere with these processes leading to aberrant gene expression, DNA instability, and eventual disease; and 3) possible cancer-suppression effects through reductions in cell proliferation, angiogenesis, oxidative stress, inflammation, and nitric oxide synthesis At the same time, because PLP is the metabolically active form of B6, it is thought to be responsible for instances of vitamin B6 toxicity . High circulating pyridoxine levels may have direct toxic effects on peripheral sensory ganglia neurons in the lower blood–nerve barrier, whereas the blood–brain barrier protects neurons in those regions from higher levels . The negative impact of B6 upon levels of other B vitamins appears to be dose-dependent and occur with chronic exposure ",
      "Warnings": "Long-term intake of high doses vitamin B6 can lead to nerve problems ",
      "Adverse Reactions": "High concentrations of vitamin B6 may result in severe peripheral sensory neuropathies and ataxia. Toxicities have reversed following discontinuation in some instances , but some case reports of neurotoxicity have not been reversible Case reports\nIrreversible sensory ataxia in octogenarians: Three elderly patients in their eighties presented with sensory ataxia (lack of voluntary coordination of muscle movements) and signs of polyneuropathy (damage or disease affecting peripheral nerves) for 3–8 months. Pyridoxine 600 mg daily was consumed for 3–10 years in a B1-6-12-combination tablet. B6 blood levels were markedly elevated at 66–104x ULN. After 2 years of vitamin discontinuation, the patients showed no significant improvement in either neuropathy or gait, and no other likely cause for neuropathy in these patients could be identified Severe sensorimotor neuropathy: Due to B6 hypervitaminosis in a 75-year-old white man, accompanied by yellowish-brown skin pigmentation. Discontinuation of B6 led to improvement 1 year later, when he no longer used a wheelchair and could walk without a cane. Skin color also resolved, but ataxic signs were still present ",
      "Herb-Drug Interactions": "Altretamine: Pyridoxine may diminish its therapeutic effect Oral contraceptives: May moderately increase pyridoxine requirements Levodopa: Enhances levodopa metabolism, thereby reducing its effects Penicillamine: May increase the requirements for pyridoxine Seizure medications (phenytoin, phenobarbital): High-dose pyridoxine may decrease serum concentrations ",

      "How It Works": "Vitamin C is important for maintaining general health, but vitamin C supplementation may not help lower the risk of cancer.Vitamin C is an essential nutrient that must be gained from sources outside the human body. It is an antioxidant used for colds and for cancer prevention because it is thought to protect cells from free radical damage. It is also important for the production of proteins and formation of collagen in the skin. Therefore, vitamin C helps promote wound healing and a deficiency can cause scurvy. In addition, scientists think that vitamin C might help reduce inflammation. Oral vitamin C supplements are not an effective cancer treatment. Clinical studies using high doses of injectable vitamin C do show promising results, but more studies are needed. Vitamin C may also make some chemotherapy drugs less effective. Patients should speak with their doctor before using vitamin C, especially during cancer treatment.",

      "Special Point": "Laboratory experiments and animals studies suggest that cancer cells preferentially uptake vitamin C. This raises the possibility that high-dose vitamin C may be detrimental to cancer patients.Some practitioners recommend using vitamin C supplements to reduce the side effects of chemotherapy and radiation therapy. However, it is controversial whether antioxidants like vitamin C can also lessen the effects of these treatments, which work by creating free radicals to kill cancer cells. So what protects healthy cells may protect cancer cells as well. This question is still not fully understood and patients who are interested in taking antioxidant supplements should consult with their doctor.",
      "Scientific Name": "Ascorbic Acid, C6H8O6",
      "Clinical Summary": "Vitamin C, also known as ascorbic acid, exists as either ascorbic acid or ascorbate. It is a water-soluble vitamin that is found in many fresh fruits and vegetables, and is essential for a variety of physiologic functions including formation of collagen and catecholamines, and carnitine and peptide synthesis . It is not synthesized in the human body, and deficiency can cause scurvy. Oral vitamin C is consumed as an antioxidant supplement for immune protection against colds and the flu, wound healing, cardiovascular health, and cancer prevention. High-dose intravenous (IV) vitamin C is being studied as a cancer treatment.The purported effects of vitamin C have been examined in many clinical and epidemiologic studies. Regular intake of vitamin C supplements may reduce duration and severity of the common cold. However, the effect is minimal except in people exposed to acute severe physical stress . Vitamin C is believed to promote cardiovascular health but findings are inconsistent. Previous studies suggest that intake of dietary vitamin C, not supplements, may reduce the risk of coronary heart diseases . However, two large-scale randomized trials did not find any benefits . Further, supplementation with vitamins C and E increased risk of mortality and nonfatal myocardial infarction in patients with coronary artery disease . Data on vitamin C’s effect in reducing blood pressure are also conflicting Vitamin C supplementation may reduce blood glucose and lipids in type 2 diabetes patients . It also decreases urinary infection rates in pregnant women ; lowers incidence of organ failure and shortens ICU stay after surgery ; and protects against Alzheimer’s disease . Vitamin C can help eradicate H. pylori infection when added to a standard medication regimen  and supplementation may potentiate treatment efficacy in some patients with thalassemia . However, antioxidants including vitamin C do not prevent or slow the progression of age-related cataracts  or macular degeneration . Vitamin C may also reduce endurance training efficiency Data do not support prophylactic vitamin C to lower postoperative atrial fibrillation incidence among cardiac surgery patients , but one study reported a reduction in other postsurgical side effects . In adults undergoing oral surgery, vitamin C reduced postoperative pain without increased side-effects in one study The role of vitamin C in cancer prevention is unclear. Studies indicate that it reduces oxidative stress . High plasma levels of vitamin C are associated with lower gastrointestinal cancer incidence probably due to its protective effects against dietary carcinogenic nitroso compounds . Intake of vitamins A, C, or E reduced risk of cervical cancer , but they do not prevent gastrointestinal , prostate , lung cancers  , or other cancer incidences, or affect cancer mortality . Further, vitamin C supplementation is associated with increased risk of liver cancer, although this effect is not observed with vitamin C from dietary sources High-dose vitamin C has been long been used as an alternative cancer treatment  based on the hypothesis that the formation of new collagen resists malignant infiltration . Early reports using parenteral plus oral ascorbic acid showed promising results . But subsequent randomized, placebo-controlled trials in advanced cancer patients using 10 g per day of oral vitamin C did not demonstrate significant benefits . This lack of effect is explained by the finding of a pharmacokinetic study that ascorbic acid can only reach a limited plasma concentration through oral administration . A higher pharmacologic concentration, achieved only via intravenous injection, had selective cytotoxic effects on cancer cell lines . Ascorbic acid is postulated to act as a carrier of hydrogen peroxide to the extracelluar fluid  where it generates free radicals against tumor cells . High-dose IV ascorbic acid up to 1.5 g /kg/day , or used with chemotherapy  appears to be well-tolerated. It may improve the quality of life of terminal cancer patients , and reduce chemotherapy-associated toxicity . This led to a renewed interest in studying high-dose IV vitamin C as an anticancer treatment . However, it should be regarded as an investigational drug and used only in a clinical trial setting.There are conflicting theories against the use of vitamin C supplements during chemotherapy. In vitro and animal studies found that cancer cells preferentially uptake vitamin C  and render some chemotherapy drugs less effective . Also, a major concern surrounding use of antioxidants, such as vitamin C, is that they can interfere with the actions of chemotherapy and radiation therapy that rely on the production of reactive oxygen species for their cytotoxic activities . However, a clinical study showed that ascorbic acid does not reduce the therapeutic effects of paclitaxel and carboplatin . Another study found an increase in chemotherapy-associated adverse effects with inadequate intake of vitamin C in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia . In other preliminary studies, short-term vitamin C plus E supplementation during radiotherapy had a protective effect against xerostomia for patients with head and neck cancer , and a combination of vitamins C, E, and selenium lessened radioiodine-induced oxidative stress in thyroid cancer patients Adverse effects from vitamin C are rare but there are reports of gastrointestinal upset, kidney stone formation  , and hemolytic anemia in patients with G6PDH deficiency . Patients with a history of oxalate kidney stones, renal insufficiency, hematochromatosis, or those undergoing chemotherapy should consult their physicians before taking vitamin C supplements.",

      "Mechanism of Action": "Vitamin C is essential for the formation and polymerization of collagen; therefore deficiency results in scurvy and poor wound healing . Vitamin C also inhibits hyaluronidase leading to the hypothesis that it can prevent cancer metastasis by strengthening the buildup and preventing the breakdown of collagen Ascorbic acid acts as an antioxidant (reducing agent) to protect against oxidative damage from free radicals . It inactivates nitric oxide and improves endothelium-dependent vasodilation , and acts via different mechanisms depending on its plasma concentration. Plasma concentrations <0.1mM are achieved through oral intake of dietary or supplemental forms. At pharmacologic plasma concentrations of 0.3 - 20mM via intravenous injection, ascorbic acid is oxidized to an ascorbate radical which acts as a prodrug for hydrogen peroxide formation within interstitial fluids . This induces DNA damage and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) depletion, and triggers ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)/adenosine monophosphate–activated protein kinase (AMPK) and inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in cancer cells Other preclinical studies suggest that ascorbate can regulate hematopoietic stem cell function and leukemogenesis . In leukemia cells, vitamin C compensated for Tet2 mutations to restore normal function . In non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and glioblastoma (GBM) cells, pharmacological ascorbate selectively sensitized these cells . Ascorbate decreases colon cancer cell proliferation by downregulating specificity proteins (Sp) . It depletes ATP and induces autophagy and cell death in prostate cancer cells . Preferential oxidative cytotoxic effects on cancer cells may be due to the presence of intracellular iron , copper , an increase in p53 activity , and overexpression of sodium-dependent vitamin C transporter 2 (SVCT-2) Dehydroascorbic acid, the oxidized form of vitamin C, may have cytoprotective effects by preserving mitochondrial membrane potential ",

      "How It Works": "Adequate vitamin D intake is needed for bone health and other important biologic functions. There are links between increased vitamin D intake and reduced risk of breast and colorectal cancers, but protection against other cancers remains unclear.Vitamin D is an essential vitamin that is found in certain foods such as fortified milk and cereals, egg yolks, and fish. It is also produced in skin that is exposed to sunlight. Its primary function is to maintain adequate blood calcium and phosphorus levels by increasing absorption of these minerals from the diet through the small intestine. When dietary calcium intake is too low, vitamin D helps move calcium stores from the bones into the blood.Vitamin D is also involved in many other biologic functions such as immune and hormone regulation, and has anti-cancer properties. Intake of vitamin D through diet may protect against breast or colorectal cancers or improve markers of prostate cancer. However, effects against other cancers remain unclear.The Institute of Medicine recommends a higher Dietary Allowance of vitamin D at 600 IU/day with the Upper level Intake at 4,000 IU/day for bone health. Scientists know that it is helpful to take vitamin D supplements when patients are deficient in this vitamin, and certain populations including cancer patients can be especially prone to this deficiency. However, there is some debate about what level of supplementation is appropriate. Patients should consult with their physicians if more vitamin D is needed for health maintenance or to treat deficiency.",
      "Purported Uses": [
        [
          "To prevent or treat cancer",
          "Intake of vitamin D through diet may protect against breast or colorectal cancers or affect markers for prostate cancer. However, vitamin D by itself does not prevent or treat cancer. Other large studies show that high vitamin D levels do not reduce the risk of many other cancers, and may increase risk for pancreatic or aggressive prostate cancer. More studies are needed to evaluate vitamin D in different populations."
        ],
        [
          "For immune regulation",
          "Vitamin D contributes to hormone regulation and other processes involving immune function. In addition, a deficiency in this vitamin can be prevalent in certain populations, including those with cancer or autoimmune disorders. However, studies on effects of vitamin D supplementation on immune regulation are lacking."

        [
          "To prevent osteoporosis",
          "Several clinical trials and population studies show that adequate levels of vitamin D intake are needed to prevent osteoporosis and bone fractures. In postmenopausal women and elderly populations, vitamin D supplementation may improve bone mineral density and help to prevent fractures."

      "Scientific Name": "Calciferol, ergocalciferol (D2), calcitriol, cholecalciferol (D3)",
      "Clinical Summary": "Vitamin D refers to several forms of fat-soluble vitamins found in fortified milk and cereals, egg yolks, and fish. The two forms utilized in humans are ergocalciferol (D2) and cholecalciferol (D3). Sunlight can promote the synthesis of D3 in the skin. Vitamin D maintains serum calcium and phosphorus levels by regulating their absorption and excretion, and is important for bone formation. Other biologic functions include its role as an antiproliferative agent , and as a pro-differentiation hormone  with anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory effects Vitamin D improved bone mineral density and fracture prevention in the elderly  and in postmenopausal women . However, there are conflicting data for primary fracture prevention in men or women when combined with calcium supplements . In another study, high-dose vitamin D had no benefit on lower extremity function, and was associated with increased risk of falls Results from studies evaluating its effect on cardiovascular (CV) risk factors have varied across populations and regimens: in a Women’s Health Initiative sub-study, calcium+vitamin D and hormone therapy had a greater effect than either intervention alone or placebo ; but daily vitamin D did not appear to improve CV risk factors or physical function in a large long-term trial of older adults . Yet in another placebo-controlled trial, vitamin D supplementation benefitted diabetic patients with coronary artery disease who were vitamin D-deficient . In addition, a single large dose of vitamin D2 improved endothelial function in type-2 diabetic patients . In non-dialysis patients with chronic kidney disease, D3 was more effective than D2 in raising serum D levels Vitamin D supplementation did not decrease incidence or severity of upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) in healthy adults  or prevent viral upper respiratory tract infections in children . It also did not reduce infections or antibiotic use in an elderly population , or improve seasonal affective disorder (SAD) . Other studies suggest that D3 supplementation can reduce relapse risk in patients with Crohn’s disease , and that D3+calcium may reduce weight gain in postmenopausal women . A single oral high-dose of D3 significantly improved fatigue in healthy persons who were vitamin D-deficient A recent study provides evidence of increased risk for development of multiple sclerosis in women with vitamin D deficiency Vitamin D has been examined for its benefits as a preventive agent and as a treatment for many types of cancer. In animal models, dietary vitamin D3 demonstrates chemopreventive effects against breast cancer equivalent to those elicited by calcitriol without causing hypercalcemia . In humans, vitamin D from sunlight exposure and dietary intake may have protective effects against breast cancer , and correlates with observations in many breast cancer survivors who were vitamin D-deficient . In postmenopausal women who do not use estrogen therapy, vitamin D and calcium supplementation may reduce the incidence of colorectal cancer ; and in women with grade 1 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, long-term vitamin D supplementation resulted in regression and in improved metabolic status . However, in a large trial of healthy postmenopausal women with mean vitamin D levels above those of the US population, taking vitamin D3+calcium did not lower cancer risk after 4 years of supplementation . In men, vitamin D improved pain and muscle strength in patients with advanced hormone-refractory prostate cancer , and slowed the rate of rise of prostate specific antigen . In older patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, vitamin D supplementation normalized deficient levels and enhanced rituximab efficacy . Active vitamin D compounds may also decrease the incidence of post-transplant malignancy among kidney transplant recipients Increased vitamin D intake reduces the risk of colorectal cancer , but has no effect on colorectal adenomas . High circulating vitamin D levels may also not reduce the risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma , ovarian , kidney , endometrial , skin , or esophageal and gastric  cancers, and may significantly increase risk of pancreatic  or aggressive prostate cancer . Other data reveal vitamin D deficiency was highly prevalent in advanced pancreatic cancer  and colorectal cancer patients The most recent meta-analyses evaluating vitamin D supplementation for cancer prevention in adults indicates that although it decreased cancer mortality and all-cause mortality, these findings are at risk of error due to the small numbers of participants across studies and attrition bias . More studies are needed to evaluate its effects in different populations, such as patients with low vitamin D status, men, and younger adults, using longer treatment durations and higher dosages.Low vitamin D levels are associated with a greater risk of mortality  and may affect cardiovascular health , but a large study found no association between low vitamin D levels and cognitive function . However, vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy may affect the neurocognitive development of newborns . A vitamin D deficiency can also cause rickets or other bone disorders, and may be a risk factor for extraskeletal diseases . Deficiencies can be particularly prevalent with certain demographics including time of year or living in northern climates ; in non-Caucasian race  or obese individuals ; with chronic use of steroids or anticonvulsants; or with diseases such as autoimmune disorders , cystic fibrosis , kidney disease, and cancer The Institute of Medicine generally recommends a Daily Dietary Allowance of vitamin D at 600 IU/day with the Upper Level Intake at 4,000 IU/day for bone health , but food sources are limited. Oral supplementation has been shown to be the safest way to increase vitamin D levels , although considerable debate continues on how this may translate in optimizing vitamin D status . Therefore, patients should consult with their physicians if a deficiency is suspected to assess whether more vitamin D is needed for health maintenance and to avoid side effects such as kidney stones or high levels of calcium in blood or urine.",

      "Mechanism of Action": "The most biologically active metabolite of vitamin D is calcitriol, which regulates calcium and phosphate homeostasis In humans, the primary function of vitamin D is to maintain normal levels of serum calcium and phosphorus concentrations by enhancing small intestine dietary absorption efficiency of these minerals. 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] enhances the efficiency of calcium and phosphorus absorption along the entire small intestine, but primarily in the duodenum and jejunum . When dietary calcium intake is insufficient, 25(OH)D and parathyroid hormone (PTH) mobilize monocytic stem cells in the bone marrow to become mature osteoclasts. These osteoclasts mobilize calcium from the bones, thereby maintaining blood calcium levels . Vitamin D is thought to have physiological effects in other parts of the body as vitamin D receptors (VDRs) are also found in the cells of other organs, like the intestine, kidney, stomach, brain, prostate, breast, and white blood cells The anticancer effect of vitamin D is thought to be due to induction of cell differentiation  and antiproliferation . In lymphoma cells, interventional 25(OH)D3 to normalize levels (>30 ng/mL) resulted in significantly stronger antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, suggesting benefit in D-deficient individuals receiving chemotherapies such as rituximab that utilize this mechanism . In xenograft models of breast cancer, dietary D3 elevated circulating D levels and increased CYP27B1 expression in both tumor and intestines, suggesting it stimulates local calcitriol synthesis in the tumor microenvironment and promotes ensuing paracrine/autocrine actions that contribute to its anticancer activity . The upregulation of CYP27B1 expression by tumors was unique to D3 versus calcitriol in the same tissue . In other animal models, a positive feedback signaling loop between the serine-protein kinase ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) and the VDR was identified as critical for cancer chemoprevention by vitamin D Calcitriol, the hormonally active form of vitamin D3, targets the vitamin D degrading enzyme CYP24A1, which is most abundant in the kidney, but also expressed in several other tissues . CYP24A1 overexpression in colon, ovary, breast, lung, and esophageal malignancies, likely leads to degradation of the locally available D3, impairing its antitumorigenic action in the tumor tissue ",

    "details": {
      "How It Works": "A diet containing adequate amounts of vitamin E is important in maintaining general health, and may prevent against some forms of cancer. The ability of vitamin E to prevent or treat Alzheimer’s disease, rheumatoid arthritis, or heart disease requires further study.\nVitamin E, also known as alpha-tocopherol, is a natural antioxidant that is found in foods such as plant oils, eggs, nuts, green leafy vegetables, and whole grains. The major function of vitamin E is to act as a free-radical scavenger, meaning that it neutralizes free radicals and protects cells from their damaging effects. Therefore, vitamin E is being investigated in conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease and cancer, in which free radical damage is known to play a part. (See the Research Evidence section for more information about this.)\nVitamin E also lessens the blood’s ability to clot by suppressing the number of adhesion molecules on the lining of the blood vessel walls. With fewer adhesion molecules, cells in the blood are less likely to “dock” on the blood vessel wall and start forming a clot. In addition, vitamin E causes the release of prostacyclin, which itself dilates the blood vessels and inhibits blood clotting. This may be helpful in patients with coronary artery disease, in which blood clots can form around atherosclerotic plaques in coronary arteries.\nScientists think that vitamin E also inhibits a molecule called protein kinase C, which is involved in cell proliferation and differentiation in smooth muscle, platelets, and monocytes (a type of immune cell). Although in theory this would be helpful against cancer cells, this effect has not been strongly shown in humans. An animal study shows NAC can speed up the growth of lung cancer cells due to its antioxidant activity.",
      "Purported Uses": [
        [
          "To prevent the progression of Alzheimer’s disease",
          "One clinical trial showed that vitamin E helped prevent progression of Alzheimer’s disease. A few population-based studies have suggested that high intake of vitamin E in the diet is associated with a lower risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease."
        ],
        [
          "To treat arthritis",
          "One clinical trial suggested that vitamin E can relieve pain in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, but has no anti-inflammatory effect. No other clinical trials have tested this use."
        ],
        [
          "To prevent cancer",
          "Large population-based studies in Finland found that taking vitamin E supplements reduced the risk of prostate and colorectal cancers in male smokers. However, initial data from the large-scale SELECT (Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention) Trial shows vitamin E taken alone or with selenium for five years, did not reduce the risk of prostate cancer. Vitamin E supplementation had no effect on lung, urinary tract, pancreas, mouth or stomach cancer risks. Another trial in",
          "patients with head and neck cancers found that patients who received vitamin E had a higher rate of second primary cancers compared with those on placebo, and that vitamin E may interfere with radiation therapy."
        ],
        [
          "To manage heart disease",
          "Data from clinical trials show that vitamin E does not help prevent heart disease."
        ],
        [
          "To prevent cataracts",
          "Two clinical trials do not support this use"

        [
          "To prevent the cardiovascular complications of diabetes",

        "To treat liver diseases",
        "Vitamin E can be used to treat fatty liver disease not caused by alcohol in adults",
        [
          "To stimulate the immune system",
          "No scientific evidence supports this use."

      "Patient Warnings": [
        "A recent analysis of seven brands of commercially available vitamin E found their actual content to vary considerably from the labeled dosage, from 41% less than the labeled amount, to 57% more.",
        "This product is regulated by the FDA as a dietary supplement. Unlike approved drugs, supplements are not required to be manufactured under specific standardized conditions. This product may not contain the labeled amount or may be contaminated. In addition, it may not have been tested for safety or effectiveness."

          "warfarin or other blood thinners:",
          "Doses of vitamin E greater than 400 IU per day may increase the risk of bleeding. PT and INR should be monitored if vitamin E is started or discontinued."

      "Side Effects": [
        "Symptoms of vitamin E toxicity from long-term consumption of >400-800 IU per day include: fatigue, dizziness, weakness, headache, blurred vision, rash, and thrombophlebitis (inflammation of a vein due to a blood clot).",
        "Vitamin E may increase the risk of stroke."
      ],
      "Special Point": [
        "Natural vitamin E supplements that are derived from plant oils contain d-alpha-tocopherol, which is believed to be the active form, while synthetic vitamin E supplements are a mixture of d-alpha-tocopherol and l-alpha-tocopherol (inactive forms).",
        "It is controversial whether antioxidants like vitamin E can lessen or negate the effects of chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Because these therapies work by creating free radicals that kill cancer cells, some physicians have suggested that high levels of antioxidants can neutralize these free radicals and thereby protect cancer cells from these therapies. So what protects healthy cells may protect cancer cells as well. This question is still not fully understood and patients who are interested in taking more than the RDA of any antioxidant should consult with their doctor."

Although available in a variety of formulations, only the d-isomer is considered active Studies evaluating vitamin E supplementation suggest that it may improve immune response in the elderly. Vitamin E may slow the progression of Alzheimer’s disease ; however, conflicting data from another study do not support the utility of antioxidants (vitamin E, vitamin C, lipoid acid, and Coenzyme Q) .  It was also ineffective in arresting the development or progression of macular degeneration  and Early Parkinson’s Disease \nVitamin E did not decrease the incidence of acute respiratory tract infections , reduce mortality, or reduce the risk of cardiovascular death or cerebrovascular accident . When taken along with vitamin C, vitamin E may increase mortality and nonfatal myocardial infarction in patients with coronary artery disease . Further, findings from the recent Physicians’ Health Study II show that neither vitamin E nor C is beneficial in preventing cardiovascular events; vitamin E may actually increase the risk of stroke . The Women’s Health Study also failed to find any benefit of vitamin E supplementation in lowering the risk of heart failure in healthy women . A meta-analysis showed that vitamin E increases the risk for hemorrhagic stroke but reduces the risk of ischemic stroke . Vitamin E can reduce signs and symptoms of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis in adults , but not in children and adolescents Vitamin E was shown to reduce the risk of some cancers . It may help to relieve hot flashes in breast cancer survivors , and to reduce the incidence of cisplatin-induced neurotoxicity . However, data suggest that supplementation with vitamins C, E, and beta carotene is not beneficial in preventing cancer incidence or affecting cancer mortality . Furthermore, vitamin E when used alone or with other supplements did not prevent gastrointestinal cancer . A large scale clinical Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT) evaluated the role of vitamin E in prostate cancer prevention. Initial review shows that vitamin E taken alone or with selenium for 5 years did not reduce the risk of prostate cancer ; observational data from 7 years of participant follow-up indicate a significant increase in the risk of prostate cancer with vitamin E supplementation . Vitamin E, when used together with soy and selenium, did not prevent prostate cancer progression . Further, findings from other studies indicate vitamin E may actually increase risk of lung cancer  and overall mortality . At the same time, conflicting data suggest an association between dietary tocopherol and a reduction in risk of lung cancer . Also, both dietary and supplemental form of vitamin E may reduce the risk of liver cancer \nToxicity may occur with chronic supplementation of vitamin E with doses greater than 800 IU. Daily supplementation over 400 IU may increase all-cause mortality . Vitamin E may also enhance the activity of warfarin, but data are inconsistent ",

      "Mechanism of Action": "Vitamin E is a fat soluble vitamin that acts as an antioxidant. The natural form of vitamin E is composed of 4 different tocopherols and 4 different tocotrienol homologues (alpha, beta, delta and gamma). All 8 forms have antioxidant activity but recent data indicate that the different homologues have different activities unrelated to antioxidant effects Gamma-tocopherol is a stronger inhibitor of cyclooxygenase and traps reactive oxygen species more effectively than alpha-tocopherol. In vitro and in vivo, gamma-tocopherol exhibits anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects where alpha-tocopherol does not  . While both alpha- and gamma-tocopherols exhibit anti-inflammatory effects in vitro and in vivo, gamma-enriched mixed tocopherols may be more potent compared to alpha-tocopherols. This may help explain the negative outcomes of recent large-scale intervention studies that used only the alpha homologue The d-alpha-tocopherol isomer is believed to be the active principle. Natural vitamin E supplements contain d-alpha-tocopherol derived from plant oil sources, whereas synthetic supplements are composed of a racemic mixture of d- and l-alpha-tocopherols. The major function of d-alpha-tocopherol is to prevent the propagation of free radical reactions by acting as a peroxyl radical scavenger and protecting polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) within membrane phospholipids and in plasma lipoproteins. Alpha-tocopherol reportedly causes inhibition of protein kinase C activity, which is involved in cell proliferation and differentiation in smooth muscle cells, human platelets, and monocytes. Vitamin E enrichment of endothelial cells, down regulates the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), thereby decreasing the adhesion of blood cell components to the endothelium. Vitamin E also upregulates the expression of cytosolic phospholipase A2 and cyclooxegenase-1, which leads to the release of prostacyclin, a potent vasodilator and inhibitor of platelet aggregation in humans In an animal study, vitamin E increased lung cancer cell proliferation due to its antioxidant activity by reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS), DNA damage and p53 expression ",
      "Warnings": "A recent analysis of 7 brands of commercially available vitamin E revealed actual content to vary considerably from the labeled dosage, from 59% to 157% of stated amount ",
      "Adverse Reactions": "Vitamin E supplementation may increase the risk of hemorrhagic stroke Toxicity: Thrombophlebitis, long term consumption of doses greater than or equal to 400-800 IU per day, may cause fatigue, dizziness, weakness, headache, blurred vision, and rash ",
      "Herb-Drug Interactions": "Although many research protocols use milligrams of vitamin E, most commercial products are sold in international units (IU). One IU natural vitamin E equals 0.67 mg d-alpha-tocopherol and one IU of synthetic vitamin E equals 0.45 mg d-alpha-tocopherol.Warfarin: It has been reported that vitamin E at doses greater than 400 IU per day may increase the effect of warfarin, although data are inconsistent ",

Supporters claim that it contains a high concentration of oxygen molecules (30,000 parts per million) dissolved in distilled water, which is unlikely because the maximum solubility of oxygen in water at room temperature is only 7500 parts per million. Vitamin O can be classified as an oxygen therapy because it is based on the idea that cancer and many other diseases are caused by a build-up of toxins in the body due to pollution, processed foods, and other factors. Promoters believe that by supplying high levels of oxygen to the body, vitamin O can detoxify the organs and kill cancer cells. Studies in animal have shown that inhaling oxygen-rich air has anticancer activities. However, oxygen is absorbed through the lungs. Taking oxygen supplements by mouth is unlikely to have the same effect.",

The anticancer activity of vitamin O is based on the theory that cancer cells grow in an oxygen-poor environment and cannot proliferate in oxygen-rich conditions.Vitamin O was advertised in national newspapers for mail-order purchase until the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) filed a complaint against its marketers, Rose Creek Health Products, Inc., and Staff of Life, Inc., in March 1999. The FTC found, contrary to the advertisement claims, that Vitamin O does not allow oxygen molecules to be absorbed through the gastrointestinal system, does not prevent or treat any physical ailment or disease, does not have a beneficial effect on human health, has not been proven effective by medical or scientific research, and was not developed by NASA for use of astronauts ",

Stress, toxins, and the modern diet of processed foods, fats, sugar, alcohol, white flour, and caffeine are said to make the body oxygen-deficient because more oxygen is required to metabolize them Vitamin O marketers misappropriate the discovery of higher atmospheric oxygen levels in past geologic eras to conclude that: the human body evolved to function at higher concentrations of oxygen than is now available; the dissolved oxygen content of most people’s bodies is considerably lower than that needed to maintain sufficient metabolism; and that the lower the level of dissolved oxygen in a person’s body, the greater the susceptibility to disease.While supplemental respiratory oxygen is thought to have anticancer activities by enhancing T cells and NK cells , none of the claims on oral vitamin O supplement are supported by laboratory or clinical evidence.",

Although it appears to increase estrogen receptor (ER) activity, WGE enhanced efficacy of tamoxifen, an ER antagonist, in ER+ breast cancer cells  as well as cisplatin in ovarian cancer cell lines . Animal models suggest WGE can reduce cardiovascular symptoms due to chronic hypertension, diabetes, and obesity , mitigate symptoms associated with lupus , and that its antitumor effect is comparable to other endocrine treatments Data from pilot studies indicate a beneficial role for WGE in patients with colorectal cancer  and in reducing treatment-associated febrile neutropenia in pediatric cancer patients . It also prolonged survival of patients with melanoma when used with chemotherapy . However, these effects must be confirmed by large-scale, well-designed clinical trials.Because it potentiates estrogen receptor activity, patients with hormone-sensitive cancers should use WGE with caution.",

It also increases tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and cytokine production by activating metabolic pathways involved in tumor cell death . WGE demonstrated cytotoxic effects on human lymphoma cells by inducing apoptosis  and against ovarian cancer cells via poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)-1 and PARP-12 expression .

      "How It Works": "Wheat grass juice has not been shown effective in treating cancer or AIDS.\nThe juice extracted from the leaves of wheat grass is believed to prevent tooth decay, reduce high blood pressure and arthritis pain, and treat chronic fatigue syndrome and the common cold. It is also being promoted as a cure for cancer and AIDS. Proponents of wheat grass believe that the chlorophyll present in the leaves increases hemoglobin content in the blood because both molecules are similar in structure. It is also thought that the enzymes present in wheat grass help to rid the body of toxins and carcinogens. However, none of these claims is backed by scientific studies.Wheat grass is not known to cause any serious side effects. However, the juice can be contaminated with mold or bacteria as the leaves are grown for 7–10 days before the juice is extracted.",

        "Contamination by microbials is possible as wheat grass sprouts are grown for 7–10 days before the leaves are harvested."
      ],
      "Scientific Name": "Triticum aestivum",
      "Clinical Summary": "Wheat grass is prepared by sprouting wheat seeds in water for 7–10 days before harvesting the leaves. Because the leaves are fibrous and difficult to digest, the juice from the leaves is extracted and consumed raw. Proponents believe the enzymes responsible for detoxifying the body are deactivated by the cooking process. Wheat grass is also marketed as a nutritional supplement in powder form.Wheat grass juice has been claimed to neutralize toxins and carcinogens in the body, prevent tooth decay, reduce high blood pressure, and aid in the treatment and prevention of cancer and AIDS. It is also used to improve digestion, prevent hair from graying, for common colds, cough, rheumatic pain, chronic fatigue syndrome, ulcers, and skin conditions. However, none of these claims are supported by clinical studies.Wheat grass proponents also equate its major constituent chlorophyll to hemoglobin, and believe that wheat grass consumption can increase oxygenation in the body. However, these concepts are not supported by current scientific understanding.Animal models suggest that wheat grass may have hypolipidemic  and antioxidant  effects. Wheat grass supplementation reduced plasma lipid peroxidation levels in healthy volunteers engaged in regular exercise . A small study and systematic review indicate that wheat grass juice may be helpful for ulcerative colitis . Other studies are mixed on whether it can reduce the need for transfusions in patients with thalassemia major . Wheat grass juice may decrease myelotoxicity in breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy .  There is also a report that wheat grass juice can reduce serum ferritin in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome . Larger studies are needed to evaluate these findings.Nausea has been reported following consumption of wheat grass juice. Because it is consumed raw, microbial contamination is also a concern.",

      "Mechanism of Action": "Wheat grass is a natural source of vitamins and minerals, including vitamins A, C, E, K and B-complex, and iron, calcium, magnesium, and selenium. It also contains chlorophyll, amino acids, bioflavonoids such as apigenin, and phenolic compounds  . Some components may have antioxidant effects, as increases in glutathione and vitamin C levels have been noted . Reductions in neutropenic fever and infection with wheat grass may relate to anti-inflammatory properties of apigenin, which can inhibit adhesion of leucocytes to endothelial cells . Some constituents may have iron chelation activity In animal models, hypolipidemic effects occur through increased fecal cholesterol excretion , decreased total cholesterol and malondialdehyde levels, and increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol Claims that raw wheat grass can “detoxify” the body and that chlorophyll can augment hemoglobin production are not supported by scientific evidence.",
      "Adverse Reactions": "Nausea, difficulties in swallowing the juice due to strong grass-like taste Because wheat grass is grown for a period of 7–10 days before harvesting leaves, microbial contamination is possible. This may cause harmful effects upon ingestion.",

      "Clinical Summary": "Derived from the root of a twining vine, wild yam was traditionally used for its antispasmodic and anti-inflammatory properties to treat menopausal symptoms, gastrointestinal ailments, muscle spasm, asthma, joint pain, and rheumatoid arthritis . Wild yam has antiproliferative  and antimitotic effects  in vitro, and animal models also suggest it has antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory properties . Diosgenin, the active ingredient in wild yam, was shown to have estrogenic and progestogenic effects in mice Two small studies on whether wild yam can relieve menopausal symptoms had opposing results, with one demonstrating an oral D. alata formula to be more effective than placebo , but another study showing a topical D. villosa formula to be ineffective . A study of dietary yam was found to improve sex hormone and lipid profiles . More studies are needed to confirm whether dietary or supplemental wild yam actually has any benefits for menopausal symptoms.Wild yam extract is sold as a dietary supplement, liquid extract or as a cream. Diosgenin in wild yam has been used as raw material for synthetic progesterone, but there is no evidence that the human body can convert diosgenin into progesterone.",

      "Mechanism of Action": "Although anti-inflammatory activity is mostly attributed to salicin , a main bioactive compound in willow bark, catechol and flavonoid compounds have also been found to be responsible . Willow bark inhibits pro-inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha), cyclo-oxygenase (COX)-2, and nuclear translocation of the transcription factor NF-κB . It was also found to significantly raise low glutathione (GSH) levels, thereby limiting lipid peroxidation Antiproliferative effects on human colon and lung cancer cells are due to growth-inhibition and apoptotic induction . In vitro and animal models suggest salicin can inhibit reactive oxygen species (ROS) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathways to produce antiangiogenic effects ",
      "Warnings": "Due to potential for bleeding complications , willow bark should be discontinued before surgery or chemotherapy.\nThose with impaired thrombocyte function should avoid willow bark, as it may interfere with blood clotting ",
      "Contraindications": "Allergy or sensitivity to salicylates such as aspirin.",
      "Adverse Reactions": "Gastrointestinal discomfort; allergic reaction, erythema, pruritus (sudden rash, itching) \nMay inhibit platelet aggregation or cause bleeding complications Anaphylaxis: In a 25-year-old woman with a history of allergy to acetylsalicylic acid, from the use of a supplement promoted for weight-loss that contained willow bark Acute respiratory distress syndrome: In a 61-year-old woman with history of hypertension and osteoarthritis after taking a willow bark supplement. Symptoms included sudden dyspnea and non-productive cough, and there was no history of drug or supplement allergy ",
      "Herb-Drug Interactions": "Warfarin or other anticoagulants: When used concurrently, willow bark may increase the risk of bleeding ",

      "Scientific Name": "Pausinystalia yohimbe, Corynanthe johimbe",
      "Clinical Summary": "Yohimbe is derived from the bark of the yohimbe tree, an evergreen native to West Africa. It has been used as an aphrodisiac for several centuries. Marketed as a steroid substitute and for weight loss, yohimbe is also used with other supplements in formulas to enhance athletic performance.The active component, an alkaloid called yohimbine, has been tested in clinical studies to treat sexual dysfunction in men and women . It was prescribed as an oral treatment for erectile dysfunction (ED) prior to the approval of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors. However, more recent analyses determined there is a lack of direct evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of oral yohimbine in nonorganic (psychogenic) ED, with no support for its use in organic ED . In veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder, yohimbine increased acoustic startle reflex . A preliminary randomized trial suggests that it may be effective for improving presyncopal symptoms in patients with severe orthostatic hypotension . Other studies have noted its ability to attenuate pressor responses in patients with Parkinson’s disease and neurogenic orthostatic hypotension . Preliminary studies of yohimbine on athletic performance  and xerostomia provide only limited additional information . Yohimbe products are among dietary supplements with the largest number of documented contraindications . They are also responsible for the most frequent toxic effects reported  and severe events requiring hospitalization ",
      "Purported Uses2": [
        "Athletic performance",
        "Orthostatic hypotension",
        "Salivation",
        "Sexual dysfunction",
        "Stimulant",
        "Weight loss"
      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "Effects on erectile dysfunction may result from the inhibition of presynaptic-α1-adrenoceptor activity in cavernous smooth muscle cells as well as its impact on nitric oxide (NO) and cGMP formation involving endothelium and endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) activity, which is testosterone-dependent . Yohimbe also has dilatory effect on genital blood vessels, enhanced genital tissue sensation, and increased reflex excitability in the sacral region The active constituents are indole alkaloids, including yohimbine , which possesses endothelin-like actions and affects NO production in renal circulation , and exerts anxiogenic effects through the noradrenergic pathway, which activates the HPA stress axis . As an α2-adrenoreceptor antagonist, yohimbine enhances norepinephrine release, increases parasympathomimetic activity, and reduces sympathetic activity . Blocking of α2-adrenoreceptors also results in increased blood supply to cavernous body tissue and increased plasma levels of noradrenaline by increasing its release from the sympathetic nervous system . In patients with orthostatic hypotension, yohimbine produces a pressor effect by engaging residual sympathetic tone ",
      "Warnings": "Yohimbine can potentially interact with numerous drugs causing severe adverse effects. Do not use if you have high blood pressure, heart disease, arrhythmias, Parkinson’s disease, seizure disorders, kidney, thyroid, or liver disease, sexual organ inflammatory disorders, ulcers, or psychiatric disorders. Do not take with antidepressant medications or with foods containing high amounts of tyramine (such as cheese, red wine, liver), or with decongestants, diet aids, or phenylpropanolamine-containing products.",
      "Contraindications": "Cardiovascular disease, hypertension, liver disease, kidney disease, posttraumatic stress disorder, anxiety, bipolar disorder, depression, mania, schizophrenia, benign prostate hypertrophy, pregnancy ",
      "Adverse Reactions": "Hypertension, anxiety, nervousness, nausea, dizziness, tachycardia, palpitations, insomnia, urinary frequency, diarrhea, manic symptoms Case reports\nFatalities following accidental yohimbine overdose: Medical examiners attributed 2 unrelated fatalities to accidental acute yohimbine intoxication, due to substantial yohimbine blood concentrations (7,400 and 5,400 ng/mL) and in the absence of other significant positive findings for both cases Acute neurotoxic effects: Malaise, vomiting, loss of consciousness, and repeated seizures in a 39-year-old body builder following ingestion of yohimbine 5g. Glasgow Coma Score indicated the need for orotracheal intubation. Symptoms subsided 12 h posttreatment with furosemide, labetalol, clonidine, and urapidil as well as gastrointestinal decontamination Erythrodermic skin eruption, progressive renal failure, and lupus-like syndrome: In a 42-year-old black man following treatment with yohimbine. Patient was admitted and received aggressive hydration, Eucerin cream with 1% hydrocortisone cream for the entire body and betamethasone valerate 0.1 % cream for hands. Patient was discharged after 2 weeks with symptom resolution, although he was readmitted 4 months later for additional clinical presentations Severe priapism: In a 42-year-old man with complex medical history after ingestion of yohimbe extract. Treatment involved insertion of a proximal cavernosal spongiosum shunt ",

      "Clinical Summary": "Yunnan Baiyao (YNBY; “White medicine from the Province of Yunnan” in Mandarin), is among the well-known proprietary traditional Chinese medicine products. It was formulated a century ago and became a popular remedy for wound healing during the Vietnam War. In the last few decades, the trade name YNBY has been expanded into a product line that includes pills, tincture, and toothpaste. The original formula is believed to contain multiple herbs with notoginseng as the main ingredient. It is also promoted as a dietary supplement that can be used both externally and internally to stop bleeding and to treat cancer in humans and in animals. Other claims include relief from minor aches and pains of muscles and joints associated with backache, arthritis, strains, bruises, sprains, and frostbite In vitro and animal studies indicate that YNBY and notoginseng have hemostatic , anti-inflammatory  and antimicrobial  effects. Notoginseng by itself demonstrated anticoagulant, antiplatelet , and fibrinolytic  activities.Clinical studies suggest that YNBY may be effective in treating uterine hemorrhage, ulcerative colitis and skin ulcers . It also reduced intraoperative blood loss during transurethral resection of prostate  and during oral surgery . Case reports indicate that YNBY reduced bleeding in cancer patients . But YNBY has not been studied as a cancer treatment.Ginsenosides derived from notoginseng were shown to exert estrogenic effects , and may stimulate the growth of hormone-sensitive breast cancer cells ",

      "Mechanism of Action": "YNBY demonstrates hemostatic effects when applied topically on open wounds . Microscopic examination identified nanofiber components in YNBY which may help to activate blood clotting. This carbon-based nanofiber also acts as a scaffolding for tissue repair and prevents infection by sealing up the wound An in vitro study on the wound-healing effects of YNBY suggests anti-inflammatory activity through suppression of lymphocyte growth and expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines . YNBY extract may be useful for rheumatoid arthritis by activating intracellular prostaglandin E(2) and thromboxane B(2) in osteoblasts When taken internally, YNBY can improve circulation and reduce swelling and bruises. The effects may be due to the anticoagulant and antiplatelet effects  exerted systemically by notoginseng via reduction of fibrinogen in blood . Notoginseng also was found to protect endothelial function  and vascular integrity by regulating Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK), integrin expression and NF-kappa B functions ; and to inhibit vascular intimal hyperplasia by lowering the expression of Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA), cyclinE, cyclinD1, FN and MMP-9. YNBY also showed antimicrobial activity. In a Pseudomonas aeruginosa model, a water extract of YNBY reduced bacterial virulence by affecting the quorum-sensing (QS) signaling circuit and by reducing the formation of biofilm \nIn other studies, notoginsenoside Ft1, a saponin constituent of notoginseng, induced platelet aggregation by binding to platelet P2Y receptors . It demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting neutrophil function and NO and PGE2 production, through reduced expression of iNOS and COX-2 . A study conducted on peritoneal macrophages found that notoginseng inhibits COX-2 expression at an early stage, elevating it at a later stage . Data also suggest it can inhibit expression of NF-kappaB activity and TNF-alpha mRNA . Notoginseng may play a role in the treatment of periodontal diseases by suppressing MMP-2 expression and by inhibiting breakdown of bone tissue . In another study, Ginsenoside-Rd, isolated from notoginseng, has been shown to reduce atherosclerosis by inhibiting LDL uptake and cholesterol accumulation in macrophages \nSome studies report that notoginseng and the constituent ginsenosides mimic estrogen  by binding and activating the estrogen receptor  and ER-alpha pathway . In an animal study, notoginseng selectively sensitized tumor cells to radiation . However, this effect has not been demonstrated in humans.",

      "Scientific Name": "Hydrated alkali aluminum silicate",
      "Clinical Summary": "Zeolites are a group of chemically related mineral substances that contain mainly hydrated aluminum and silicon compounds. They occur naturally in volcanic rock and ashes and are also formulated synthetically. Zeolites are marketed as dietary supplements for autism, diarrhea, herpes, hangover, to balance body pH, and as a heavy-metal detoxifier, immunomodulator, and antioxidant.Industrial and agricultural applications include their use as additives in gravel, detergents, and animal feed, in water and air purifiers, and in some personal care products. Benefits of using zeolites in animal feed include increased mineral utilization , reduction of heavy metals-induced anemia , and reduction of aflatoxin toxicity . However, none of these benefits are applicable to humans. In addition, this use has raised concerns about accumulated tissue aluminum in treated livestock  vis-a-vis the known link of aluminum to several morbidities including Alzheimer’s disease Generally, the various forms of zeolite are not significantly toxic in acute, short-term oral, or parenteral toxicity studies in animals. However, inhalation toxicity is readily demonstrated , and erionite, a type of airborne fibrous zeolite, has been associated with high incidence of malignant mesothelioma , and geologic occurrences of erionite are emerging as a concern for respiratory illness in the United States.Zeolites have limited use in medicine as an external hemostatic dressing for trauma-related injuries , potential for controlled drug delivery, as a suspending agent, or for use in cardiopulmonary bypass and hemodialysis procedures A small pilot study sponsored by the manufacturer of a proprietary oral zeolite supplement in immunodeficient patients suggests some immunomodulatory effects , but no additional studies validate these claims. In an Alzheimer’s mouse model, zeolite reduced oxidative damage and plaque generation . Two older animal studies suggest that micronized zeolite may have anticancer benefits , but this also has not translated into any further studies. Currently, no studies of zeolite as a cancer treatment in humans have been published.Special Point: A company filed a U.S. patent application in 2001 for a synthesized form of zeolite as a cancer drug . Data submitted were based on in vitro, plant, and animal studies. The patent specified that the substance must be injected directly into the tumor, which rules out any benefits by oral route.",

      "Mechanism of Action": "Zeolites are hygroscopic compounds with a fine porous cage-like structure that allows for its ion-exchanging, adsorbent, anticaking, chelating, and desiccant characteristics . Its ion-exchanging properties may alter the ionic composition, pH and buffering capacity of the gastrointestinal tract under conditions of overexposure Zeolite controls bleeding by absorbing water from the hemorrhage site through an exothermic reaction which supports the concentration of coagulation factors and platelets, causing clot formation . Zeolite pH buffering effects also adsorb nitrosamines in acidic solution , leading to unsubstantiated claims that it could remove carcinogenic substances in the stomach.In vitro studies indicate that micronized zeolite inhibits protein kinase B, induces expression of tumor suppressor proteins , and limits reactive oxygen species effects . In animal studies, it reduced metastasis and increased the effect of doxorubicin due to its antioxidant properties . Zeolites may also have both immunosuppressive and immunostimulating effects, causing a decline of GM-CFU in the bone marrow , but also increasing graft-versus-host (GvH) reaction . Zeolite can affect brain serotonergic receptor activities of mammary carcinoma-bearing mice , but the clinical implications for humans is unclear. Zeolite supplementation did not prolong survival in tumor-bearing animals ",

      "How It Works": "Zinc supplementation may reduce the length of a cold when taken within 24 hours of symptoms. Studies examining whether zinc can help symptoms from cancer treatment have mixed results.Zinc is necessary for a number of processes in the human body. Many enzymes depend on zinc in order to function, including those involved in processing DNA, detoxifying alcohol, and carrying carbon dioxide in the blood. Zinc is essential for normal cell functioning, nerve signaling, and for the body to protect itself against infection or disease. In addition, it affects the lifecycle and communications of cells.Scientists think that zinc lozenges may prevent the common cold virus from attaching to the nasal cavities, windpipe, and lungs. Zinc interacts with the outer layer of the virus and prevents its ability to grow into full-blown virus particles in lab tests.Zinc may help to reduce some symptoms caused by radiation therapy in head and neck cancers patients. It was also shown to improve survival in patients with advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Optimal levels of zinc may also reduce the risk of various cancers, but further study is needed.",

      "Clinical Summary": "Zinc is an essential element necessary for human physiologic functions including enzymatic reactions, bone formation, and regulation of synaptic signaling. It is thought to have antioxidant and immunostimulant activities and is used as a dietary supplement to treat the common cold, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, warts, and male infertility. Zinc deficiency is relatively rare in the United States, and more common among developing countries, patients with various health conditions, and some who habitually consume vegetarian diets . Zinc sulfate is the most studied supplement, but it is also sold in other forms such as gluconate for better absorption. It is also an ingredient in some over-the-counter products such as cold remedies, topical creams, and denture adhesives.Zinc may reduce rhinoviral infection and replication. Short-term use of zinc lozenges reduces symptoms associated with the common cold but results are inconsistent . Data analysis of 18 clinical trials suggests that in otherwise healthy individuals, zinc supplementation reduces duration but not severity of cold symptoms when administered within 24 hours of onset . Intranasal zinc products used to treat colds have been removed from the market due to adverse events, and were found to damage human nasal tissue Zinc supplementation may reduce acute upper respiratory infections or diarrhea among infants . However, study results among children with cystic fibrosis are mixed , and a Cochrane review cites a lack of corresponding reduction in required intravenous antibiotics . Zinc supplementation also had a negative treatment effect in severe pediatric bacterial pneumonias, causing significantly longer hospital stays and slower recovery In nursing home elderly, zinc supplementation increased serum zinc concentrations and was associated with enhanced T-cell function . However, zinc was not found to be an effective treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, and serum zinc concentrations can actually be higher in patients with RA than healthy individuals Studies have found that zinc supplementation can reduce markers of insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome in children  and reduce the severity of diarrhea . It also may be effective for the treatment of tinnitus but not in the elderly . Both oral and topical zinc show efficacy in treating warts , but there does not appear to be an advantage with topical zinc over mainstream treatments Zinc deficiency has been linked to various chronic ailments , infertility , and increased mortality . Animal models and human studies have also linked zinc deficiency to an increased risk of developing esophageal squamous cell carcinoma  while both deficiency and excess zinc intake (more than 100 mg/day) have been linked to prostate cancer . However, zinc >15 mg/day for 10 years was found to decrease risk of advanced prostate cancer . At the same time, epidemiological studies have illustrated a relationship between high zinc levels in breast tissue and breast cancer . Taken together, the research suggests that optimal zinc intake plays a role in achieving protective effects.Zinc may help control some cancer treatment symptoms, but evidence is mixed. Zinc supplementation may benefit oral cancer patients receiving radiation to prevent mucositis , but another study in head and neck cancer patients found no significant benefit , and there are conflicting results regarding its efficacy for taste preservation . Zinc supplementation also does not prolong survival in this population , but may improve overall survival in patients with advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma . Zinc supplementation may help reduce infection episodes in children with leukemia undergoing chemotherapy . In two small studies of colorectal cancer patients, zinc supplementation during chemotherapy prevented fatigue , increased superoxide dismutase activity, and maintained vitamin E concentrations . Further research is needed to confirm these findings.",

      "Mechanism of Action": "Zinc is a component of many proteins and performs a number of catalytic, structural, and regulatory functions. It is essential for the structural formation of biologically active molecules such as copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn SOD), and enzymes including RNA polymerases, alcohol dehydrogenase, carbonic anhydrase, and alkaline phosphatase that depend on zinc as a cofactor . Zinc influences protein kinase C activity, immunocompetence, apoptosis, and metallothionein levels and has a number of antioxidant and antiinflammatory functions  . However, whether zinc elicits antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, or antiapoptotic effects is concentration-dependent and relies on an intricate balance. Under conditions of zinc overload or deficiency, zinc ions become pro-oxidant, proinflammatory, and proapoptotic Mechanisms that link zinc to tinnitus include cochlear Cu/Zn SOD activity and synaptic transmission . Its role in taste perception likely relates to the presence of alkaline phosphatase within the taste-bud membrane . Zinc accumulation in bone tissue activates alkaline phosphatase and stimulates collagen synthesis in osteoblasts, which are involved in bone mineralization and calcification . Zinc has the ability to complex with viral coat proteins, altering assembly of viral particles , and its deficiency increases humoral and cell-mediated immunity dysfunction and susceptibility to infection . Supplemental zinc can reduce the ability of the rhinovirus to attach to the human respiratory tract . In patients with a common cold, zinc decreases plasma soluble interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (sIL-1fa) and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), a cellular receptor for rhinovirus . In men with reduced sperm motility, zinc supplementation reduces oxidative stress, apoptosis, and sperm DNA fragmentation Zinc works with metallothioneins, Cu/Zn SOD, and p53 to combat oxidative stress and mediate DNA damage response and repair . In vitro, intracellular zinc accumulation inhibits proliferation of human prostate cancer cells by causing G2/M arrest and upregulating CDKN1A gene expression, which expresses p21 . Further, zinc deficiency depresses nuclear p21 and p53 levels . Animal models of esophageal cancer demonstrate that zinc-deficiency induces overexpression of proinflammatory mediators S100a8 and S100a9 as well as chemokines, chemokine receptors, cytokines, and Cox-2 . Zinc replenishment reduces and also reverses these proinflammatory signatures Zinc dyshomeostasis has been implicated in breast cancer as a modulator of oxidative stress, DNA damage response/repair pathways, and cell proliferation/apoptosis . A diverse group of zinc transporters other than those associated with breast cancer play a role in regulating cell proliferation and apoptosis in prostate, pancreatic and ovarian cancers, suggesting zinc dysregulation in cancer is cell-type specific ",
      "Warnings": "Consumption of zinc >100 mg/day may increase the risk of prostate cancer When taken orally at large doses (100-300 mg/day), zinc can cause chronic toxicity including copper deficiency, depressed immune function, headache, chills, fever, and fatigue . Individuals should also be aware of common products that may accidentally lead to this type of excess exposure, such as zinc-containing denture adhesives, that have caused serious systemic adverse effects (see following case reports) ",
      "Adverse Reactions": "Oral, Common: Taste disturbances, nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia, and diarrhea Oral, Toxicity: Copper deficiency, depressed immune function, headache, chills, fever, and fatigue Topical: Itching or pain, hypopigmentation, erythema, swelling, scaling, blackening Case reportsAnosmia caused by intranasal application: More than 130 reports of anosmia—the loss of sense of smell—led to the removal of intranasal zinc from the market Hyperzincemia and hypocupremia from overuse of zinc-containing denture adhesives: Serious adverse systemic effects include elevation of serum zinc levels resulting in depressed levels of serum copper, which can cause bone marrow depression, widespread sensory and motor neuropathies, or myelopathy ",
      "Herb-Drug Interactions": "Fluoroquinolones (e.g. ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, gatifloxacin): Concomitant administration of zinc results in reduced bioavailability of fluoroquinolones. Zinc should be administered either 2 hours before or 4 hours following fluoroquinolone intake.Tetracyclines (e.g. doxycycline, minocycline): Concomitant administration of zinc results in reduced bioavailability of tetracyclines. Zinc should be administered either 2 hours before or 4 hours following tetracycline intake.Penicillamine: Coadministration with zinc may result in decreased penicillamine levels Thrombopoietin receptor agonists: Significant reduction in eltrombopag absorption due to chelation when coadministered with a polyvalent cation-containing antacid. Therefore, there should be at least 4 hours between eltrombopag and any zinc-containing medication or supplement Minerals / VitaminsIron: Concurrent iron and zinc supplementation may decrease absorption or impair bioavailability of both elements Although human studies have been equivocal, patients should take zinc 2 hours before or after foods that are high in calcium, phosphorus, bran fiber, or phytate to avoid nonabsorbable complexes ",

      "Clinical Summary": "Zyflamend is a formulation containing 10 different herbs. It is marketed as a dietary supplement for healthy inflammation response and normal cardiovascular and joint function Preliminary studies suggest that the ingredients in Zyflamend have anti-inflammatory, antiangiogenic, and antiproliferative properties . Zyflamend inhibits the proliferation of oral squamous carcinoma , pancreatic cancer , and melanoma cells in vitro . In an animal model, it inhibited the growth of both hormone-sensitive and hormone-insensitive prostate cancer, and reduced the expression of prostate specific antigen (PSA) . It can also suppress elevated levels of proinflammatory mediators and aromatase in obese models . In a phase I trial in men with prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, Zyflamend did not cause any serious adverse events, and significant reductions in serum levels of C-reactive protein and nuclear factor-kappa B levels were observed . More studies are warranted.Zyflamend may potentiate the cytotoxic effects of certain chemotherapeutic agents, including gemcitabine , taxol , doxorubicin , and bicalutamide ",

        "Antiaging",
        "Cancer treatment",
        "Inflammation"
      ],
      "Mechanism of Action": "Ingredients in Zyflamend, including holy basil, turmeric, ginger, green tea, rosemary, hu zhang, Chinese gold thread, and Scutellaria, inhibit cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) activity and thereby reduce inflammation. In vitro studies showed that Zyflamend inhibits inflammatory enzymes, decreases retinoblastoma (Rb) protein phosphorylation , and induces apoptosis in human prostate cancer cells . It also reduced androgen receptor signaling and enhanced bicalutamide-induced apoptosis . In melanoma cells, it induces autophagy and apoptosis sequentially by activating the intrinsic caspase cascade. Cell migration and COX-2 expression were also suppressed . In myeloid leukemia cells and lung adenocarcinoma cells, it inhibits osteoclastogenesis and NF-kappa B activation . It also inhibits NF-kappa B activation and enhances gemcitabine-induced apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells Both a cellular model of obesity-related inflammation and an obese animal model indicate that Zyflamend blocks proinflammatory mediators and aromatase induction as well as Akt and NF-kB activation. Increased aromatase mRNA levels and mammary gland activity were also partially inhibited In a murine xenograft model of prostate cancer, Zyflamend was shown to inhibit androgen-dependent tumor growth and histone deacetylase-5, biomarkers linked to prostate cancer progression . It also reduced the number of inflammatory cells, hyperplasia and dysplasia, and tumor incidence and number, and inhibited cell proliferation in an animal model of oral squamous cell carcinoma ",
      "Contraindications": "Hypersensitivity to any of the constituents",
      "Adverse Reactions": "Bad taste in the mouth, heartburn, and diarrhea ",
      "Herb-Drug Interactions": "Chemotherapy drugs (gemcitabine, taxol, doxorubicin, bicalutamide): Zyflamend may have additive effects Other prescriptions drugs: Because Zyflamend contains many herbal constituents, it can potentially interact with prescription drugs.",
